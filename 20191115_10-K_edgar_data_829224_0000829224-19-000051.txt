PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 General 
 Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 81 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market NASDAQ under the symbol SBUX. We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl S. A. ("Nestl "). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana, Seattle s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, Ethos, Starbucks Reserve and Princi. 
 Our objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve this, we are continuing the disciplined expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S., and in newer, higher growth markets such as China, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model, we continue to offer consumers new coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels and alternative store formats. We also believe our Starbucks Global Social Impact strategy, commitments related to ethically sourcing high-quality coffee, contributing positively to the communities we do business in and being an employer of choice are contributors to our objective. 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K 10-K or Report for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 fiscal 2019 ), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as Starbucks, the Company, we, us or our. 
 Segment Financial Information 
 Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned Starbucks operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. Specifically, our previous China/Asia Pacific ("CAP") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") segment have been combined into one International segment. Concurrently, results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks Reserve TM Roastery Tasting Rooms, certain stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which were previously included within Corporate and Other, are now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations. 
 We have three reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada, and Latin America; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2019 were as follows: Americas 69 ), International 23 and Channel Development 8 ). 
 Our Americas and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are either in various stages of development or undergoing transformations of their business models. Therefore, they may require a more extensive support organization, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our Americas operations. 
 Our Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Seattle's Best Coffee , Starbucks- and Teavana-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino , Starbucks Doubleshot , Starbucks Refreshers beverages and Teavana TM/MC iced tea, and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Historically our consumer packaged goods ("CPG") have been sold directly to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies. With the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl , a large portion of our Channel Development business transitioned to a licensed model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Our collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Anheuser-Busch InBev, Tingyi Holding Corp., Arla Foods and others for our global ready-to-drink beverage businesses in this segment are excluded from the Global Coffee Alliance.

The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region. 
 Company-operated Stores 
 Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for 81 of total net revenues during fiscal 2019 . Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique Starbucks Experience . The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service and a seamless digital experience as well as clean and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty. 
 Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior and local business practices.

Starbucks company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and in select rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly Drive Thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store formats, which are focused on an elevated Starbucks Experience for our customers.

 Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program 
 The Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan, and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained on-line, via the Starbucks Mobile App, and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points Stars earned. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. 
 Licensed Stores 
 Revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11 of total net revenues in fiscal 2019 . Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model. 
 In our licensed store operations, we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.

 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Historically, revenues have included domestic and international sales of our packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink products to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies. With the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, other revenues include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestl under this arrangement and the amortization of the up-front prepaid royalty. See Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Deferred Revenues, for further information. Our collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Anheuser-Busch InBev, Tingyi Holding Corp., Arla Foods and others for our global ready-to-drink beverages businesses in this segment are excluded from the Global Coffee Alliance. 
 Product Supply 
 Starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees. 
 The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the C coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In

 Table of Contents 

addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. 
 
 We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars to hedge "C" price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2020 . 
 We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote. 
 To help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates nine farmer support centers. The farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts. 
 In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote. 
 Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote. 
 Competition 
 Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores. 
 Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. 
 Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names 
 Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, Seattle s Best Coffee, Teavana, Frappuccino and Starbucks VIA are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. 
 We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including Starbucks.com, Starbucks.net, Starbucksreserve.com, Seattlesbest.com and Teavana.com. 
 Seasonality and Quarterly Results 
 Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Employees 
 Starbucks employed approximately 346,000 people worldwide as of September 29, 2019 . In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 218,000 people, with approximately 209,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in support facilities, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately 128,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 124,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. The number of Starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant. We believe our current relations with our employees are good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. Our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to Starbucks or competitors' lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry. 
 
 Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results. 
 We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. 
 Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. Such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well, our brand value may be diminished.

If our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer. 
 Our global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. 
 We also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. And although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served in those locations. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results. 
 
 Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business. 
 Instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. Any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) and/or temporary store closures. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error. 
 We also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. We monitor the operations of certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products. 
 Additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls or food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations. 
 
 The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. 
 Many of our information technology systems (and those of our licensees and other third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs, and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third parties' information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers' or employees' data or confidential information of the Company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. For example,

the European Union adopted a new regulation that became effective in May 2018, called the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet the GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. Additionally, the California Privacy Act of 2018 CCPA ), which was enacted in June 2018 and will come into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party s information technology systems. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability. 
 Compliance with the GDPR, the CCPA and other current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. 
 Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breach information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss. 
 
 We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results. 
 We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners or service providers systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. 
 
 We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. 
 There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include: 
 
 being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience; 
 
 building our leadership position around coffee; 
 
 11 

 Table of Contents 

driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally; 
 
 simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers; 
 
 increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats; 
 
 moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets; 
 
 creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup; 
 
 continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with Nestl and other Channel Development business partners; 
 
 delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business, including our tea business through the Teavana brand in our Starbucks retail stores and other channels and internationally; and 
 
 reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses. 
 In addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following: 
 
 imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees; 
 
 construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the U.S. and internationally; 
 
 not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings; and 
 
 the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives. 
 Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, such as large acquisitions and integrations, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results. 
 
 Evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business. 
 Our continued success depends on our ability to retain and convert customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by on-line commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to "brick mortar" retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Teavana brand in our Starbucks retail stores and other channels) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations. 
 The growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements. Our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the

speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestl , which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestl fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, the growth of our Channel Development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses. 
 There are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. If they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets. 
 
 Changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business. 
 Increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers compensation insurance costs and increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets. Furthermore, the growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience which could materially harm our business and results of operations. 
 
 We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. 
 The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products or flattening demand for our products, could have a negative effect on our business. 
 
 We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our Americas operating segment. 
 Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 69 of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2019 . If the Americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our U.S. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. And because the Americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders. 
 
 We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets. 
 Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. Some or all of our international market business units MBUs ), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results. 
 The International segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our Americas segment. In particular, our China MBU contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating income. China is currently our fastest growing market and second largest market overall. With our acquisition of the East China business, the China market is 100 company-owned. Due to the significance of our China market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following: 
 
 13 

 Table of Contents 

the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-Americanism; 
 
 entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China; 
 
 changes in economic conditions in China and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs; 
 
 ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to food safety, tariffs and tax, bringing uncertainty and inconsistent interpretations, which may be contrary to ours, as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; 
 
 food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety; and 
 
 the ability to successfully integrate the East China business. 
 Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the U.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations. 
 
 We face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance. 
 We operate in over 80 markets globally. Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as: 
 
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies; 
 
 changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets; 
 
 interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations; 
 
 uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the United Kingdom's referendum to withdraw membership from the European Union (referred to as Brexit ), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications; 
 
 restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership; 
 
 import or other business licensing requirements; 
 
 the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; 
 
 limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations; 
 
 in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast; 
 
 difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets; 
 
 local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; and 
 
 delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. 
 Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects.

Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. 
 The availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the C price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the C coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base C coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. 
 The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. 
 We also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. 
 
 Our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. 
 Our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations: 
 
 increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets; 
 
 adverse outcomes of litigation; 
 
 severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; 
 
 especially in our large markets, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets, social unrest, and health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores; and 
 
 the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR after 2021 and the replacement with an alternative reference rate may adversely impact interest rates. 
 
 Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability. 
 Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. 
 Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and 
 
 15 

 Table of Contents 

prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability. 
 
 Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. 
 Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales growth, operating cash flows, shareholder returns and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance. 
 
 The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results. 
 Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees on whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results. 
 Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. Changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments, and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. 
 In addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business. 
 In addition, the European Commission in July 2016 and the Swiss Government in January 2017 approved the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, respectively, which are designed to allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with the Privacy Shield requirements to freely import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. However, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework approved by the European Commission which is relied upon for transfers of personal data outside the European Economic Area could be invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The potential invalidation of this mechanism could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area.

The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. 
 
 Overview 
 Starbucks results for fiscal 2019 reflect the impacts of continued streamlining efforts, initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and converting several market operations, including Thailand, France, and the Netherlands, to fully licensed models in fiscal 2019. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, we saw the full impact from the licensing of the majority of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned our operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. Specifically, our previous China/Asia Pacific ("CAP") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") segment have been combined into one International segment. Results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks Reserve TM Roastery Tasting Rooms, certain stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which were previously included within Corporate and Other, are now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations. As a result, we have three reportable operating segments: Americas, International and Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. 
 Further, to better support the review of our results, we have changed the classification of certain costs. The most significant change was the reclassification of company-owned store occupancy costs from cost of sales to store operating expenses. We also made certain other immaterial changes. 
 Concurrent with the change in reportable segments and realignment of certain operating expenses noted above, we revised our prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income, or net earnings per share as a result of these changes. 
 In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. Our U.S. corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2019 and future years is 21 , while a blended rate of 24.5 was applied in fiscal 2018. 
 
 Financial Highlights 
 
 Total net revenues increased 7 to 26.5 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to 24.7 billion in fiscal 2018 . 
 
 Consolidated operating income increased to 4.1 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to operating income of 3.9 billion in fiscal 2018 . Fiscal 2019 operating margin was 15.4 compared to 15.7 in fiscal 2018 . Operating margin compression in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by partner (employee) investments and growth in wages and benefits, licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl and other strategic investments. These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage, cost savings initiatives, lower restructuring and impairment costs and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage. 
 
 Earnings per share EPS for fiscal 2019 decreased to 2.92 , compared to EPS of 3.24 in fiscal 2018 . The decrease was primarily driven by lapping the prior year gains from the acquisition of our East China joint venture and the sale of our Tazo brand, partially offset by the gain from the sale of our Thailand retail operations during fiscal 2019. 
 
 Capital expenditures were 1.8 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to 2.0 billion in fiscal 2018 . 
 
 We returned 12.0 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2019 through share repurchases and dividends compared to 8.9 billion in fiscal 2018 . 
 
 Acquisitions and Divestitures

Total net revenues increased 1.8 billion , or 7 , over fiscal 2018 , primarily driven by higher revenues from company-operated stores 1.9 billion ). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings over the past 12 months 957 million) and a 5 increase in comparable store sales 879 million), attributable to a 3 increase in average ticket and a 2 increase in comparable transactions. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation 189 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 161 million). 
 Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues 223 million ), primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees 228 million), largely due to the opening of 992 net new Starbucks licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets 35 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation 41 million). 
 Other revenues decreased 288 million , primarily driven by the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl . Partially offsetting this decrease was growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with the Global Coffee Alliance.

 Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 130 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by investments in our store partners that are funded by savings from the Tax Act and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by sales leverage driven by price increases and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage.

Other operating expenses decreased 184 million, primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl 176 million) and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance 34 million), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl and headcount-related costs, primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 20 basis points). 
 General and administrative expenses increased 116 million, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation 89 million) and the 2019 Starbucks Leadership Experience in Chicago, heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter 52 million). 
 Restructuring and impairment expenses decreased 89 million, primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment costs related to Teavana TM/MC retail store closures 128 million) and lower impairments related to our Switzerland retail market 27 million), partially offset by higher exit costs associated with the closure of certain Starbucks company-operated stores 32 million) and severance costs 25 million). 
 Income from equity investees decreased 3 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in East China. This decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in South Korea and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. 
 The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 .

Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture in fiscal 2018 was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50 ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition. 
 Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019. The gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. 
 Interest income and other, net decreased 95 million , primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis, which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue. We recorded store value card breakage in interest income and other, net in the prior year. 
 Interest expense increased 161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018, August 2018 and May 2019.

 Table of Contents 

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.5 compared to 21.8 for fiscal 2018 . The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act (approximately 350 basis points), lapping prior year's transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities (approximately 300 basis points), higher stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (approximately 140 basis points), the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a U.S. tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 130 basis points) and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our Thailand retail operations (approximately 130 basis points). These favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points). See Note 13 , Income Taxes, for further discussion.

Also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees 144 million), primarily resulting from comparable store sales growth and the opening of 323 net new Starbucks licensed stores, or 4 increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage 119 million). 
 Operating Margin 
 Americas operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 9 to 3.8 billion , compared to 3.5 billion in fiscal 2018 .

Partially offsetting these were cost savings initiatives, primarily in cost of sales (approximately 90 basis points), the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage (approximately 50 basis points) and sales leverage.

Discussion of our International segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our East China business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of December 31, 2017. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of East China's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. Under the company-operated ownership model, East China s operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment. 
 Re venues 
 International total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 640 million, or 12 , primarily driven by 665 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 12 increase, over the past 12 months 377 million), the ownership change in East China 280 million) and a 3 increase in comparable store sales 135 million). Also contributing were increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees 84 million), primarily resulting from opening of 669 net new Starbucks licensed stores, or an 11 increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage 20 million). These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation 183 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets 126 million). 
 Operating Margin 
 International operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 11 to 965 million , compared to 873 million in fiscal 2018 . Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.6 , primarily driven by strategic investments to support growth in China (approximately 80 basis points) and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 70 basis points), primarily offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 80 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 70 basis points).

Our Channel Development segment results reflect the impact of the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which we lapped late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the Global Coffee Alliance. 
 Revenues 
 Channel Development net revenues for fiscal 2019 decreased 305 million , or 13 , when compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl 329 million), offset by growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with our Global Coffee Alliance 25 million). 
 Operating Margin 
 Channel Development operating income for fiscal 2019 decreased 25 to 698 million , compared to 927 million in fiscal 2018 . Operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 35.0 , primarily driven by licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl (approximately 640 basis points), partially offset by lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance (approximately 140 basis points), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty and headcount-related costs, primarily related to employee bonus and retention costs.

Total net revenues increased 2.3 billion, or 10 , over fiscal 2017, primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores 2.0 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 816 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings over the past 12 months 904 million), incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in East China 903 million) and a 2 increase in comparable store sales 345 million), attributable to a 3 increase in average ticket. 
 
 Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues 297 million), primarily due to increased product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees 298 million), largely due to the opening of 1,181 net new Starbucks licensed stores over the past 12 months and the conversions of both the Singapore and Taiwan markets to fully licensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively 44 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 53 million). 
 
 Other revenues decreased 4 million, primarily driven by the absence of revenue due to the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 56 million), the closure of our e-commerce business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 51 million) and licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 50 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products 115 million).

Cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 40 basis points). 
 Store operating expenses, which include occupancy costs, as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues were flat, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by increased partner investments, largely in the Americas segment. 
 Other operating expenses increased 37 million, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the up-front payment received from Nestl . 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 60 basis points). 
 General and administrative expenses increased 300 million, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations and the 2018 U.S. stock award granted in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the Tax Act and vests over one year. 
 Restructuring and impairment expenses increased 71 million, primarily due to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada 23 million), higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our Switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit 20 million) and International restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments 18 million). 
 Income from equity investees decreased 90 million, primarily due to the impact of ownership changes in our East China and Taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher South Korea joint venture income. 
 The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 280 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.

Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50 ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition. 
 Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations primarily consisted of sales of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. The gain in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our Singapore retail operations. 
 Interest income and other, net increased 10 million, primarily due to recognizing higher income on unredeemed stored value card balances, partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the sale of our investment in Square, Inc. warrants in the prior year period. 
 Interest expense increased 78 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018 and August 2018. 
 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 21.8 compared to 33.2 for fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the Tax Act (approximately 480 basis points). The impact from the Tax Act primarily included favorability from the lower corporate income tax rate applied to our fiscal 2018 results (approximately 760 basis points) and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities (approximately 130 basis points). This favorability was partially offset by the estimated transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings (approximately 400 basis points). See Note 13 , Income Taxes, for further discussion.

 Operating Income 
 Americas operating income for fiscal 2018 decreased 3 to 3.5 billion , compared to 3.6 billion in fiscal 2017.

Discussion of our International segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our East China business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of December 31, 2017. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of East China's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. Under a company-operated ownership model, East China's operating results are reflected in most line items on the statements of earnings. 
 Revenues 
 International total net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 1.3 billion, or 32 , primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China 850 million), 433 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings, or a 12.1 increase, over the past 12 months 298 million), and favorable foreign currency translation 121 million). Also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees 100 million), primarily resulting from the opening of 669 net new Starbucks licensed stores, or a 13.6 increase, over the past 12 months and the conversion of our Taiwan joint venture to fully licensed operations at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 25 million). 
 Operating Margin 
 International operating income for fiscal 2018 increased 4 to 872.8 million , compared to 835.6 million in fiscal 2017. Operating margin decreased 420 basis points to 15.7 , primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 350 basis points). Also contributing were higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our Switzerland retail reporting unit (approximately 40 basis points) and restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments (approximately 40 basis points).

Discussion of our Channel Development segment results reflects the impact of the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl and the sale of the Tazo brand. Late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we licensed our CPG (Starbucks-, Starbucks Reserve-, Teavana-, Seattle's Best Coffee-, Starbucks VIA- and Torrefazione Italia-branded packaged coffee and tea) and Foodservice businesses to Nestl and formed the Global Coffee Alliance. Eleven months of fiscal 2018 results reflect our CPG and Foodservice businesses as company-owned and one month as licensed operations. Our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the Global Coffee Alliance. 
 Revenues 
 Channel Development net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 41 million, or 2 , over fiscal 2017. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in sales of our packaged coffee and premium single-serve products 115 million), lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment 13 million) and favorable foreign currency translation 10 million). These increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue from the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 56 million) and licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 50 million). 
 Operating Margin 
 Channel Development operating income for fiscal 2018 decreased 4 to 927.1 million , compared to 967.0 million in fiscal 2017. Operating margin decreased 250 basis points to 40.4 , primarily driven by business taxes associated with the up-front payment received from Nestl (approximately 120 basis points), Global Coffee Alliance headcount-related costs, including employee bonus and retention costs (approximately 80 basis points), and the impact of our ownership changes, including licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestl and the sale of our Tazo brand.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash and Investment Overview 
 Our cash and investments were 3.0 billion and 9.2 billion as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , respectively, with the decrease driven by the usage of the up-front prepaid royalty associated with the Global Coffee Alliance primarily for share repurchases. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and corporate debt securities. As of September 29, 2019 , approximately 1.7 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. 
 Borrowing capacity 
 Our 2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the 2018 credit facility and our 1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the 364-day credit facility are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. 
 The 2018 credit facility, of which 150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 25, 2022 . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional 500 million . Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility) in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. The current applicable margin is 0.910 for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000 (nil) for Base Rate Loans. 
 The 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, was set to mature on October 23, 2019. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the maturity has been extended to October 21, 2020 . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional 500 million . Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is 0.920 for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000 (nil) for Base Rate Loans. 
 Both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2019 , we were in

 In November 2017, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of 500 million of 3-year 2.200 Senior Notes (the 2020 notes due November 2020 and 500 million of 30-year 3.750 Senior Notes (the 2047 notes due December 2047. Interest on the 2020 notes is payable semi-annually on May 22 and November 22, commencing on May 22, 2018 and interest on the 2047 notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2018. 
 We will use the net proceeds from the offering of the 2049 notes to enhance our sustainability programs. We will use the net proceeds from these remaining offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchases of our common stock under our ongoing share repurchase program, business expansion and payment of dividends. 
 See Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt. 
 The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 29, 2019 , we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 
 Use of Cash 
 We expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and other developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. 
 We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as any shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
 We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional

 Table of Contents 

foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. We have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years' cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. This change did not have a material impact to our financial results. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need for, repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. See Note 13 , Income Taxes, for further discussion. 
 During each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2018 , we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of 0.30 per share. In the last two quarters of fiscal 2018 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 , we declared a cash dividend of 0.36 per share. Dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2019 and 2018 totaled 1.8 billion and 1.7 billion , respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 , we declared a cash dividend of 0.41 per share to be paid on November 29, 2019 with an expected payout of approximately 486 million . 
 We entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions totaling 5.0 billion , effective October 1, 2018. We made a 5.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 72.0 million shares of our common stock. In March 2019 , we received an additional 4.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of 65.03 . 
 Additionally, we entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions totaling 2.0 billion , effective March 22, 2019. We made a 2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. In June 2019 , we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of 76.50 . 
 Outside of the ASR agreements noted above, during fiscal 2019 and 2018 , we repurchased 36.6 million and 131.5 million shares of common stock, respectively, or 3.1 billion and 7.2 billion , respectively, on the open market. For fiscal 2019 , in connection with the ASR agreements and other open market transactions, we repurchased 139.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 10.1 billion. In the first quarter 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase of 120 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program. As of September 29, 2019 , 29.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. 
 Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2020 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 are expected to be approximately 1.8 billion . 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 5.0 billion for fiscal 2019 , compared to 11.9 billion for fiscal 2018 . The change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year receipt of the up-front payment from Nestl in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 
 Cash used by investing activities totaled 1.0 billion for fiscal 2019 , compared to 2.4 billion for fiscal 2018 . The change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year payment to acquire the 50 ownership interest in our East China joint venture and higher proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations. 
 Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2019 totaled 10.1 billion , compared to 3.2 billion for fiscal 2018 . The change was primarily due to lower proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. 
 
 COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS 
 Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1 , as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. 
 
 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. Excluding interest rate swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years . Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments. 
 The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.

 Table of Contents 

Commodity Price Risk 
 We purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure. 
 The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2019 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income OCI from changes in commodity prices.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion. 
 The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2019 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Equity Security Price Risk 
 We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan MDCP ). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. 
 We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10 change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 29, 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.

Interest Rate Risk 
 Long-term Debt 
 We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of September 29, 2019 .

 Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 
 Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 29, 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. 
 
 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity. 
 We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. 
 Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets 
 We evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. 
 Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses. 
 Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an 
 
 41 

 Table of Contents 

appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. 
 During fiscal 2019 , there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. 
 Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches. 
 When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. 
 When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. 
 The goodwill impairment charges are discussed in Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. 
 Income Taxes 
 We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. 
 In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates 
 
 42 

 Table of Contents 

we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). 
 In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 13 , Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities. 
 We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. 
 Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. 
 Refer to Note 13 , Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for additional discussion surrounding the changes as a result of the Tax Act.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 Fiscal Years ended September 29, 2019 , September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017 
 
 Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 Description of Business 
 We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee and tea beverages and a variety of fresh and prepared food items, through our company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and foodservice. The grocery and foodservice business is primarily through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl established in August 2018. 
 In this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as Starbucks, the Company, we, us or our. 
 Certain prior period information on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of cash flows has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
 Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned our operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. Specifically, our previous China/Asia Pacific ("CAP") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") segment have been combined into one International segment. Results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks Reserve TM Roastery Tasting Rooms, certain stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which were previously included within Corporate and Other, are now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations. 
 billion and billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Total store occupancy costs in fiscal 2019 were billion . We also made certain other immaterial changes. There was no impact to consolidated net revenues, consolidated operating income, or net earnings per share as a result of these changes and prior period financial information has been revised to be consistent with the current period presentation. 
 Additional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in Note 16 , Segment Reporting. 
 We have reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada, and Latin America; 2) International, which is inclusive of China/Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 We consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal.

million and million , respectively. 
 Inventories 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , inventory reserves were million and million , respectively. 
 to years for equipment and to years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally years . For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. 
 The portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. 
 We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level.

Additionally, we recognized net impairment charges of million , million , and million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Of the total net impairment charges, million and million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, were restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expenses. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings.

million in company-operated store revenues and million in licensed store revenues. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, breakage was recorded using the remote method and recorded in interest income and other, net. In fiscal 2018 and 2017 , we recognized breakage income of million , and million , respectively. There were no material impacts to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 including the change in income statement presentation. 
 Loyalty Program 
 Customers in the U.S., Canada, and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points Stars with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit and debit cards. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country. 
 We defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months. 
 When a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue. The new revenue recognition guidance does not impact the timing or total revenue recognized related to the loyalty program.

billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestl access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-front payment will be recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of years for the ongoing access to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant throughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we satisfy our performance obligations. At September 29, 2019 , the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestl up-front payment was million and billion , respectively. During the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 , the Company recognized million related to amortization of the up-front royalty payment. 
 Additionally, deferred revenues include our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. Changes in our deferred revenue balance related to our stored value cards and loyalty program (in millions) :

Foreign Currency Translation 
 Our international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets.

million and a corresponding cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2019. 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new FASB guidance on revenue recognition utilizing the modified retrospective method, which primarily changed the accounting method and classification of revenue recognition related to unredeemed stored value cards, referred to as stored value card breakage. Under this new guidance, expected breakage amounts must be recognized proportionately in earnings as redemptions occur. Previously, stored value card breakage was recorded to interest income and other, net utilizing the remote method. Starting in the first quarter of 2019, stored value card breakage was recorded in the revenue lines where stored value cards may be redeemed, within company-operated and licensed store revenues. The cumulative impact to retained earnings as of October 1, 2018 was million .

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance on the reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCI. The guidance permits entities to reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act from AOCI to retained earnings. The guidance will be effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and will be adopted prospectively. We do not expect a material impact upon adoption of this guidance.

 million , which was included in net gains resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. 
 In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our company-operated retail businesses in France and the Netherlands to Alsea, S.A.B. de C.V. converting these operations to fully licensed markets. These transactions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Fiscal 2018 
 We entered into an agreement on May 6, 2018 to establish the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl . On August 26, 2018, Nestl licensed the rights to market, sell and distribute Starbucks consumer packaged goods and foodservice products in authorized channels. We received an up-front payment of approximately billion consisting primarily of prepaid royalties which was recorded to current and long-term deferred revenue. See Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for the accounting treatment. 
 On March 23, 2018, we sold our company-operated retail store assets and operations in Brazil to SouthRock, converting these operations to a fully licensed market. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 On December 31, 2017, we acquired the remaining interest of our East China joint venture East China from President Chain Store (Hong Kong) Holding Ltd. and Kai Yu (BVI) collectively, Uni-President Group or UPG , for approximately billion . Approximately million of pre-existing liabilities owed by East China to Starbucks were effectively settled upon the acquisition. Acquiring the remaining interest of East China, which at the time operated over stores in the Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, built on the Company's ongoing investment in China. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on valuation and analysis performed by management. 
 Concurrently with the purchase of our East China joint venture, we sold our interest in President Starbucks Coffee Taiwan Limited, our joint venture operations in Taiwan, to UPG for approximately million . The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of million which was included in net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings.

Total consideration 

As a result of this acquisition, we remeasured the carrying value of our preexisting equity method investment to fair value, which resulted in a total gain of billion that is not subject to income tax, and was presented as gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture on our consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of billion was calculated using an income approach, which was based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses were based on internal projections and considered the historical performance of stores, local market economics and the business environments impacting store performance. The discount rate applied was based on East China's weighted-average cost of capital and included company-specific and size risk premiums. 
 The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are reported within our International segment. Other current and long-term assets acquired primarily include lease deposits and prepaid rent. Accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities assumed primarily include deferred income tax, dividend payable, accrued payroll, income tax payable and accrued occupancy costs. 
 The definite-lived intangibles primarily relate to reacquired rights to operate stores exclusively in East China. The reacquired rights of million represent the fair value calculated over the remaining original contractual period and will be amortized on a straight-line basis through September 2022 . Amortization expense for these definite-lived intangible assets was million and million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The estimated future amortization expense is approximately million each year for the next two years and approximately million in fiscal 2022. 
 Goodwill represents the intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and primarily includes the acquired customer base, the acquired workforce including store partners in the region that have strong relationships with these customers, and the existing geographic retail and online presence. The entire balance was allocated to the International segment and is not deductible for income tax purposes. Due to foreign currency translation, the balance of goodwill related to the acquisition decreased million since the date of acquisition to billion as of September 29, 2019. 
 We began consolidating East China's results of operations and cash flows into our consolidated financial statements after December 31, 2017. For the year ended September 30, 2018 , East China's revenue included in our consolidated statements of earnings was million . For the year ended September 30, 2018 , East China's net earnings included in our consolidated statements of earnings was million .

Net earnings attributable to Starbucks 

(1) 
 The pro forma net earnings attributable to Starbucks for fiscal 2017 includes acquisition-related gain of billion and transaction and integration costs of million for the year ended October 1, 2017. 
 The amounts in the supplemental pro forma earnings for the periods presented above fully eliminate intercompany transactions, apply our accounting policies and reflect adjustments for additional occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the same fair value adjustments to leases, property, plant and equipment and acquired intangibles had been applied on October 3, 2016. These pro forma results are unaudited and are not necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have occurred had the acquisition actually closed in the prior period or indicative of the results of operations for any future period. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2018, we incurred approximately million of acquisition-related costs, such as regulatory, legal, and advisory fees, which were recorded in general and administrative expenses. 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we sold the assets associated with our Tazo brand including Tazo signature recipes, intellectual property and inventory to Unilever for a total of million . The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of million , which was included in the net gain from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. Results from Tazo operations prior to the sale were reported primarily in Channel Development. 
 Fiscal 2017 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold our company-operated retail store assets and operations in Singapore to Maxim's Caterers Limited, converting these operations to a fully licensed market, for a total of million . This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of million , which was included in the net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings.

 Derivative Assets and Liabilities 
 Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps, which are described further in Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments. 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments, and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Impairment of property, plant, and equipment is included at Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 Other than the impairments discussed in Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, and the aforementioned fair value adjustments, there were no other material fair value adjustments during fiscal 2019 and 2018 .

million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contacts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base C coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to fix the base C coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base C coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote.

 Goodwill balance at September 30, 2019 

For fiscal 2018, Other primarily consists of changes in the goodwill balance resulting from transfers between segments due to the dissolution of the Teavana reporting unit. For both fiscal 2019 and 2018, "Other" also includes foreign currency translation. 
 During fiscal 2018, a strengthening Swiss franc diverted consumer traffic to neighboring countries and despite our operational investments and improvements, projections indicated that the carrying value of Switzerland goodwill balance was not fully recoverable. This resulted in an impairment charge for the remaining Switzerland goodwill balance of million . 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, management finalized its long-term strategy for the Teavana reporting unit, which included closing all Teavana-branded retail stores. As a result, we recorded store asset impairment of million and goodwill impairment of million , reducing goodwill of the Teavana reporting unit to million as of July 2, 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we dissolved the Teavana reporting unit upon completion of the retail store closures. As a result, we reorganized the Teavana business and allocated the remaining million of goodwill to other reporting units, primarily within the Americas segment, based on a relative fair value approach.

Stock Option Plans 
 We provide stock options as a form of employee compensation, which are primarily time-vested. The majority of time-vested options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire years from the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately or from grant. All outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options.

The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our anticipated cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.

 RSUs 
 We have both time-vested and performance-based RSUs. Time-vested RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, subject solely to the employee s continuing employment. The time-vested RSUs either vest in two or four equal annual installments beginning a year from the grant date. Our performance-based RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock if we achieve specified performance goals during the performance period and the grantee remains employed through the vesting period.

The purchase price is of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was million in fiscal 2019 . 
 Deferred Compensation Plan 
 We have a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors under which non-employee directors may, for any fiscal year, irrevocably elect to defer receipt of shares of common stock the director would have received upon vesting of restricted stock units. The number of deferred shares outstanding related to deferrals made under this plan is not material. 
 Defined Contribution Plans 
 We maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws.

This change did not have a material impact to our financial results. As of September 29, 2019, in foreign subsidiaries in which we are partially indefinitely reinvested, the gross taxable temporary difference between the accounting basis and tax basis was approximately 1.3 billion, for which there could be up to approximately 300 million of unrecognized tax liability.

Potential dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options (both vested and non-vested) and unvested RSUs, calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 15, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Goodwill - China Company-Operated Reporting Unit - Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 We identified goodwill for the China company-operated reporting unit China as a critical audit matter. The Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, which requires management to make subjective estimates and assumptions, particularly related to the forecast of future revenues. 
 The total goodwill balance of the International Segment was 2,958.4 million as of September 29, 2019, of which the majority was allocated to China. The sensitivity of operating results in China to changes in market risk factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory environment, and competition, required the application of a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to the forecast of future revenues. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our principal audit procedures related to the Company s forecast of future revenues used by management to estimate the fair value of China included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s goodwill impairment evaluation, including the controls related to management s forecast of future revenues 
 
 84 

 Table of Contents 

We evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future revenues by comparing actual results to management s historical forecast 
 
 We assessed the reasonableness of the forecast of future revenues by comparing the forecast to: 
 - Historical revenues 
 - Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors 
 - Forecast information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company 
 - Historical and forecast information included in macro-economic reports for the China market 
 - Subsequent forecasts, to evaluate for changes made by management since the annual measurement date through issuance of the financial statements.

 Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 , we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report September 29, 2019 ). 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 
 The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 , respectively, to this 10-K. 
 Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2019 . 
 Our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2019 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 29, 2019, of the Company and our report dated November 15, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 2. 
 Dividend Equivalents . On each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of Shares, an amount (the Dividend Equivalent Amount equal to the cash dividend that is paid on each Share, multiplied by the number of Shares subject to the Restricted Stock Units and any Dividend Equivalent RSUs (as defined below) that remain unvested and outstanding as of the dividend payment date, shall be credited for the benefit of the Participant, and such credited amount shall be converted into an additional number of Restricted Stock Units Dividend Equivalent RSUs determined by dividing the Dividend Equivalent Amount by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the dividend payment date, rounded up or down to the nearest whole number.

Unless expressly provided otherwise, as used elsewhere in this Agreement Restricted Stock Units shall include any Dividend Equivalent RSUs that have been credited to the Participant s account. 
 
 3. Termination of Employment; Change of Control . 
 
 3.1 
 Termination of Employment . Except as provided in Sections 3.1, 3.3 or 3.4 below, any unvested Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement shall immediately terminate and be automatically forfeited by the Participant to the Company upon the termination of the Participant s Active Status for any reason (as further described in Section 8(l) below), including without limitation, voluntary termination by the Participant, or termination by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company because of Misconduct. 
 
 3.2 
 Change of Control . Upon a Change of Control, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall accelerate, and the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested and payable to the extent and under the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan; provided that for purposes of this Section 3.2, Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason shall have the following meaning: 

Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason shall mean any voluntary termination by written resignation of the Active Status of a Participant after a Change of Control because of: (1) a material reduction in the Partner s authority, responsibilities or scope of employment; (2) an assignment of duties to the Partner materially inconsistent with the Partner s role at the Company (including its Subsidiaries and affiliates) prior to the Change of Control, (3) a material reduction in the Partner s base salary or total incentive compensation; (4) a material reduction in the Partner s benefits unless such reduction applies to all Partners of comparable rank; or (5) the relocation of the Partner s primary work location more than 50 miles from the Partner s primary work location prior to the Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant shall not be deemed to have Resigned for Good Reason unless the Participant, within one year after a Change of Control, (i) notifies the Company of the existence of the condition giving rise to a Resignation for Good Reason within 90 days of the initial existence of such condition, (ii) gives the Company at least 30 days following the date on which the Company receives such notice (and prior to termination) in which to remedy the condition, and (iii) if the Company does not remedy such condition within such 30-day period, actually terminates employment within 60 days after the expiration of such 30-day period (and before the Company remedies such condition). If the Company remedies such condition within such 30-day period (or at any time prior to the Participant s actual termination), then any Resignation for Good Reason by the Participant on account of such condition will not be a Resignation for Good Reason. 
 
 3.3 
 Retirement . If the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Retirement, the Participant will continue to vest in all unvested Restricted Stock Units as if the Participant s Active Status had not terminated, subject to and conditioned upon compliance with the terms of Section 4 through each Vesting Date. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in the Participant s country that likely would result in any favorable treatment of the Restricted Stock Units at Retirement under this Agreement being deemed unlawful or discriminatory, the Company may, in its sole discretion, determine not to apply such favorable treatment and treat the Restricted Stock Units as set forth in the remaining provisions of this Agreement. 
 
 3.4 
 Disability or Death . If the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Disability or death, all unvested Restricted Stock Units will vest in full as of the date of termination of Active Status due to Disability or death. 
 
 4. 
 Misconduct . As a condition to receiving and becoming eligible to vest in the Restricted Stock Units, the Participant hereby agrees not to engage in Misconduct. 
 
 5. 
 Clawback . If the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has engaged in Misconduct, the Participant agrees and covenants that (a) any unvested portion of the Restricted Stock Units shall be immediately forfeited as of the date the Company determines that the Participant has engaged in Misconduct (the Determination Date (b) if any part of the Restricted Stock Units vested and were settled prior to the Determination Date, upon the Company s demand, the Participant shall immediately deliver to the Company (i) the Shares that the Participant acquired upon settlement of such Restricted Stock Units and (ii) to the extent any such Shares were previously sold by the Participant, a cash amount equal to the Fair Market Value as of the Determination Date of the Shares contemplated to be returned to the Company under this clause; and (c) the foregoing remedies set forth in this Section Error! Reference source not found. shall not be the Company s exclusive remedies, which shall include, among other remedies, injunctive relief and damages that may be available to the Company. The Company reserves all other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity. 
 
 6. 
 Code Section 409A . The provisions in this Section 6 shall apply if the Participant is subject to taxation in the United States. 
 6.1 
 To the extent the Restricted Stock Units constitute nonqualified deferred compensation that is subject to Code Section 409A NQ Deferred Compensation ), any Restricted Stock Units that are payable upon or with reference to the date that the Participant s Active Service terminates (i) shall not be paid unless the Participant experiences a separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A and (ii) if the Participant is a specified employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A on the date of the Participant s separation from service, then the Restricted Stock Units shall be paid on the first business day of the seventh month following the Participant s separation from service, or, if earlier, on the date of the Participant s death, to the extent such delayed payment is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A. 

6.2 
 This Award and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan are intended to qualify for an exemption from or comply with Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement and the Plan, the Company, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right, but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify this Agreement and/or the Plan so that the Restricted Stock Units granted to the Participant qualify for exemption from or comply with Code Section 409A; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations that the Restricted Stock Units shall be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Code Section 409A from applying to the Restricted Stock Units. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall provide a basis for any person to take action against the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company based on matters covered by Code Section 409A, including the tax treatment of any amount paid or Award made under this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall under any circumstances have any liability to any Participant or his or her estate or any other party for any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Code Section 409A for any amounts paid or payable under this Agreement. 
 
 6.3 
 If the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units is accelerated upon a Change of Control, the Restricted Stock Units are considered NQ Deferred Compensation, and the Change of Control does not constitute a change in control event, within the meaning of the U.S. Treasury Regulations, then the cash equivalent of the Restricted Stock Units calculated as of the date of the Change in Control shall be paid on the earliest of the applicable Vesting Date, the date of the Participant s death or the date the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Disability. 
 
 7. 
 Responsibility for Taxes . Regardless of any action the Company or, if different, the Participant s employer (the Employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Participant Tax-Related Items ), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Shares in settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if the Participant is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
 
 Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or additional authorization by the Participant, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items, if any, by one or a combination of the following: 
 (a) 
 withholding from the Participant s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer; or 
 (b) 
 withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares issued in settlement of the vested Restricted Stock Units, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Participant s behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent), to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions; or 
 (c) 
 withholding in whole Shares to be issued in settlement of the vested Restricted Stock Units based on the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the date the withholding obligation arises, in an amount equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or the Employer with respect to such Award, provided, however that if the Participant is a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable 

tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case, the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (a) and (b) above. 
 The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable statutory withholding amounts in the Participant s country or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Participant s country, to the extent permitted under the Plan, in which case the Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan. In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant, and you may be required to seek a refund. 
 Finally, the Participant is required to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.

 This Appendix A, which is part of the Key Employee RSU Agreement, includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Restricted Stock Units granted to the Participant under the Plan and that will apply to the Participant if he or she is in one of the countries listed below. 
 
 If the Participant is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries after the Date of Grant, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to what extent the additional terms and conditions included herein will apply to the Participant under these circumstances.

The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of August 2019. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Participant not rely on the information in this Appendix A as the only source of information relating to the consequences of his or her participation in the Plan because such information may be outdated when the Restricted Stock Units vest and/or when the Participant sells any Shares acquired at vesting of the Restricted Stock Units. 
 
 In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to the Participant s particular situation.

 Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Foreign specified property, including shares of stock i.e. , Shares), options to purchase Shares and other rights to receive Shares e.g. , Restricted Stock Units) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of his or her foreign specified property exceeds C 100,000 at any time during the year. Thus, Restricted Stock 

Units likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C 100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign specified property the Participant holds. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base ACB of the Shares. The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if the Participant owns other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares. The Participant should consult with a personal tax advisor to ensure compliance with the applicable reporting obligations.

The Participant further agrees that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares and the Participant expressly authorizes the Company s designated broker to complete the sale of such Shares. The Participant acknowledges that the Company s designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price.

 Furthermore, the Company reserves the right not to apply Section 3.3 of the Key Employee RSU Agreement, in which case, Sections 1 and 3.1 of the Key Employee RSU Agreement shall be deemed amended, accordingly, such that no references to continued vesting after a termination due to Retirement shall apply to the Restricted Stock Units.

1. 
 Vesting Schedule . The number of Performance RSUs granted under the Award that actually vest and that will be settled shall be determined pursuant to a two-step process: (i) first the maximum number of Performance RSUs that are eligible to vest shall be determined as provided under Section 1.1 hereof on the basis of the level at which the Performance Goals specified on attached Schedule I are actually attained and (ii) then the maximum number of Performance RSUs calculated under clause (i) that will actually vest shall be determined on the basis of the Participant s completion of the requirements set forth in Section 1.2 hereof. 
 
 1.1 
 Performance Goal Requirements . The attached Schedule I specifies the Performance Goals required to be attained during the Performance Period in order for the Performance RSUs to become eligible to vest. As soon as reasonably practicable following the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion the attainment level of the Performance Goals. On the basis of the determined level of attainment of the Performance Goals, the Target RSUs will be multiplied by the applicable percentage determined in accordance with the performance matrix set forth in Schedule I. The number of Performance RSUs resulting from such determination shall constitute the maximum number of Performance RSUs in which the Participant may vest under this Award (the Earned Performance RSUs ). 
 
 1.2 
 Active Status Vesting . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Award, a number of Earned Performance RSUs will vest as detailed in the attached Schedule I of this Agreement, subject to the Participant s continued Active Status through the date the Performance RSUs are paid pursuant to Section 3. 
 
 2.

At the end of the Performance Period, the number of Dividend Equivalent RSUs will be adjusted to reflect the number of Dividend Equivalent RSUs that would have been credited to the Participant as of the Date of Grant if such calculations had been based on the number of Earned Performance RSUs (such adjusted number, the Earned Dividend Equivalent RSUs ). During the period beginning immediately following the last day of the Performance Period and ending on the date the Performance RSUs granted hereunder are paid pursuant to Section 3 below, 

Dividend Equivalent RSUs will accrue on any Earned Performance RSUs and any Earned Dividend Equivalent RSUs. Dividend Equivalent RSUs will be subject to the same conditions as the underlying Performance RSUs with respect to which Dividend Equivalent RSUs were paid, including, without limitation, the vesting conditions and the provisions governing time and form of settlement applicable to the underlying Performance RSUs. Unless expressly provided otherwise, as used elsewhere in this Agreement, Performance RSUs shall include any Dividend Equivalent RSUs that have been credited to the Participant s account. 
 
 3. 
 Form and Timing of Payment of Vested Performance RSUs . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, any Performance RSUs that vest will be paid to the Participant solely in whole Shares (and not in cash, as the Plan permits), on, or within sixty (60) days after, (i) the last day of the Performance Period, including upon a vesting resulting from the Participant s termination due the Participant s Retirement pursuant to Section 4.3 below or from the Participant s termination prior to the last day of the Performance Period resulting from the Participant s termination due to death or Disability pursuant to Section 4.4 below or (ii) a vesting event contemplated in Section 4.2 below or vesting event resulting from the Participant s termination following the last day of the Performance Period resulting from the Participant s termination due to death or Disability pursuant to Section 4.4 below. 
 4. 
 Termination of Employment; Change of Control . 
 
 4.1 
 Termination of Employment . Except as provided in Sections 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4 below, any unvested Performance RSUs subject to this Agreement shall immediately terminate and be automatically forfeited by the Participant to the Company upon the termination of the Participant s Active Status for any reason (as further described in Section 9(l) below), including without limitation, voluntary termination by the Participant, or termination by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company because of Misconduct. 
 
 4.2 
 Change of Control . Upon a Change of Control, the vesting of the Performance RSUs shall accelerate, and the Performance RSUs shall become fully vested and payable to the extent and under the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan; provided that, for purposes of this Section 4.2, "Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason" shall have the following meaning: 
 
 Resignation (or Resign) for Good Reason shall mean any voluntary termination by written resignation of the Active Status of a Participant after a Change of Control because of: (1) a material reduction in the Partner s authority, responsibilities or scope of employment; (2) an assignment of duties to the Partner materially inconsistent with the Partner s role at the Company (including its Subsidiaries and affiliates) prior to the Change of Control, (3) a material reduction in the Partner s base salary or total incentive compensation; (4) a material reduction in the Partner s benefits unless such reduction applies to all Partners of comparable rank; or (5) the relocation of the Partner s primary work location more than 50 miles from the Partner s primary work location prior to the Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant shall not be deemed to have Resigned for Good Reason unless the Participant, within one year after a Change of Control, (i) notifies the Company of the existence of the condition giving rise to a Resignation for Good Reason within 90 days of the initial existence of such condition, (ii) gives the Company at least 30 days following the date on which the Company receives such notice (and prior to termination) in which to remedy the condition, and (iii) if the Company does not remedy such condition within such 30-day period, actually terminates employment within 60 days after the expiration of such 30-day period (and before the Company remedies such condition). If the Company remedies such condition within such 30-day period (or at any time prior to the Participant s actual termination), then any Resignation for Good Reason by the Participant on account of such condition will not be a Resignation for Good Reason. 
 4.3 
 Retirement . If the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Retirement on a day following the date that is six (6) months after the Date of Grant, the Participant will continue to be eligible to vest in a number of Performance RSUs equal to the Earned Performance RSUs. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Company receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in the Participant s country that likely would result in any favorable treatment of the Performance RSUs at Retirement under this Agreement being deemed unlawful or discriminatory, the Company may, in its sole discretion, determine not to apply such favorable treatment and treat the Performance RSUs as set forth in the remaining provisions of this Agreement. 
 
 4.4 
 Death or Disability . If the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Disability or death on or prior to the last day of the Performance Period, a number of Performance RSUs equal to the Target RSUs will 

vest in full as of the date of termination of Active Status due to Disability or death. If the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Disability or death following the last day of the Performance Period, a number of Performance RSUs equal to the Earned Performance RSUs will vest in full as of the date of termination of Active Status due to Disability or death. 
 
 5. 
 Misconduct . As a condition to receiving and becoming eligible to vest in the Performance RSUs, the Participant hereby agrees not to engage in Misconduct. 
 6. 
 Clawback . If the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has engaged in Misconduct, the Participant agrees and covenants that (a) any unvested portion of the Performance RSUs shall be immediately forfeited as of the date the Company determines that the Participant has engaged in Misconduct (the " Determination Date "); (b) if any part of the Performance RSUs vested and were settled prior to the Determination Date, upon the Company s demand, the Participant shall immediately deliver to the Company (i) the Shares that the Participant acquired upon settlement of such Performance RSUs, and (ii) to the extent any of such Shares were previously sold by the Participant, a cash amount equal to the Fair Market Value as of the Determination Date of the Shares contemplated to be returned to the Company under this clause; and (c) the foregoing remedies set forth in this Section 6 shall not be the Company s exclusive remedies, which shall include, among other remedies, injunctive relief and damages that may be available to the Company. The Company reserves all other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity. 
 7. 
 Code Section 409A . The provisions in this Section 7 shall apply if the Participant is subject to taxation in the United States. 
 
 7.1 
 To the extent the Performance RSUs constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" that is subject to Code Section 409A ("NQ Deferred Compensation"), any Performance RSUs that are payable upon or with reference to the date that the Participant s Active Service terminates (i) shall not be paid unless the Participant experiences a "separation from service" within the meaning of Code Section 409A and (ii) if the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A on the date of the Participant s separation from service, then the Performance RSUs shall be paid on the first business day of the seventh month following the Participant s separation from service, or, if earlier, on the date of the Participant s death, to the extent such delayed payment is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A. 
 
 7.2 
 This Award and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan are intended to qualify for an exemption from or comply with Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement and the Plan, the Company, to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, reserves the right, but shall not be required, to unilaterally amend or modify this Agreement and/or the Plan so that the Performance RSUs granted to the Participant qualify for exemption from or comply with Code Section 409A; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations that the Performance RSUs shall be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Code Section 409A from applying to the Performance RSUs. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall provide a basis for any person to take action against the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company based on matters covered by Code Section 409A, including the tax treatment of any amount paid or Award made under this Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall under any circumstances have any liability to any Participant or his or her estate or any other party for any taxes, penalties or interest imposed under Code Section 409A for any amounts paid or payable under this Agreement. 
 
 7.3 
 If the vesting of the Performance RSUs is accelerated in connection with a Change of Control, the Performance RSUs are considered NQ Deferred Compensation, and the Change of Control does not constitute a "change in control event," within the meaning of the U.S. Treasury Regulations, then the cash equivalent of the Performance RSUs as of the date of the Change in Control shall be paid on the earliest of the applicable Vesting Date, the date of the Participant s death or the date the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Disability. 
 
 8. 
 Responsibility for Taxes . Regardless of any action the Company or, if different, the Participant s employer (the Employer takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Participant s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Participant Tax-Related Items ), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains 

the Participant s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance RSUs, including, but not limited to the grant of the Performance RSUs, the vesting or settlement of the Performance RSUs, the issuance of Shares in settlement of the Performance RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Participant s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if the Participant is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 
 
 Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant must pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or additional authorization by the Participant, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items, if any, by one or a combination of the following: 
 
 (a) 
 withholding from the Participant s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer; or 
 
 (b) 
 withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares issued in settlement of the vested Performance RSUs, either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on the Participant s behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent), to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions; or 
 
 (c) 
 withholding in whole Shares to be issued in settlement of the vested Performance RSUs based on the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares on the date the withholding obligation arises in an amount equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or the Employer with respect to such Award, provided, however that if the Participant is a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold in Shares upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case, the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (a) and (b) above. 
 
 The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable statutory withholding amounts in the Participant s country or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Participant s country, to the extent permitted under the Plan, in which case the Participant may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares underlying the vested Performance RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan. In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant, and you may be required to seek a refund. 
 
 Finally, the Participant is required to pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares. 
 
 9. 
 Nature of Grant . In accepting the Award, the Participant acknowledges, understands and agrees that: 
 
 (a) 
 the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time; to the extent permitted by the Plan;

 (c) 
 all decisions with respect to future restricted stock units or other awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;

 the Performance RSUs and the Shares subject to the Performance RSUs, and the income from and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, holiday pay, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar mandatory payments; 
 
 (h)

 (i) 
 the future value of the Shares subject to the Performance RSUs is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty; 
 
 (j) 
 after termination of the Participant s Active Status, the Participant is no longer eligible to receive any new restricted stock units under the Plan; 
 
 (k) 
 no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance RSUs resulting from termination of the Participant s Active Status (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of the Participant s employment or service contract, if any); 
 
 (l) 
 for purposes of the Performance RSUs, the Participant s Active Status will be considered terminated as of the date the Participant is no longer actively providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or affiliates (regardless of the reason for such termination and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of the Participant s employment or service contract, if any) and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., the Participant s period of service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of "garden leave" or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where the Participant is employed or providing services or the terms of the Participant s employment or service contract, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Participant s Active Status for purposes of the Award is terminated (including whether the Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence); 
 
 (m) 
 unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Performance RSUs and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Performance RSUs or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Common Stock; and 
 
 (n) 
 neither the Company, the Employer nor any other Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between Participant s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Performance RSUs or of any amounts due to the Participant

The Participant should consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding the Participant s participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan. 
 
 11. 
 Data Privacy . 
 
 a) 
 Data Collection and Usage . The Company and the Employer collect, process and use certain personal information about the Participant, including, but not limited to, the Participant s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance, passport or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all performance restricted stock units or any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, cancelled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant s favor ("Data"), for the legitimate purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. The legal basis, where required, for the processing of Data is the Participant s consent. 
 
 b) 
 Stock Plan Administration Service Providers . The Company transfers Data to Fidelity Plan Services, LLC and its affiliated companies (collectively, "Fidelity"), an independent service provider based in the United States, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan.

 c) 
 International Data Transfers . The Company and Fidelity are based in the United States. The Participant s country or jurisdiction may have different data privacy laws and protections than the United States. For example, the European Commission has issued a limited adequacy finding with respect to the United States that applies only to the extent companies register for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program. The Company is registered for this program, but only with respect to non-HR related data which does not encompass Data for purposes of this Agreement.

 d) 
 Data Retention . The Company will hold and use Data only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Participant s participation in the Plan, or as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including under tax, securities, exchange control and labor laws. This means Data may be retained until after termination of your Active Service. 
 
 e) 
 Voluntariness and Consequences of Consent Denial or Withdrawal . Participation in the Plan is voluntary and the Participant is providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If the Participant does not consent, or if the Participant later seeks to revoke his or her consent, the Participant s salary from or employment and career with the Employer will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing the Participant s consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Performance RSUs or other equity awards to the Participant or administer or maintain such awards. 
 
 f) 
 Data Subject Rights . The Participant may have a number of rights under data privacy laws in his or her jurisdiction. Depending on where the Participant is based, such rights may include the right to (i) request access or copies of Data the Company processes, (ii) rectification of incorrect Data, (iii) deletion of Data, (iv) restrictions on processing of Data, (v) portability of Data, (vi) lodge complaints with competent authorities in the Participant s jurisdiction, and/or (vii) receive a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data. To receive clarification regarding these rights or to exercise these rights, the Participant can contact his or her local human resources representative. 
 
 By accepting the Performance RSUs , the Participant is declaring that he or she agrees with the data processing practices described herein and consents to the collection, processing and use of Data by the Company and the transfer of Data 

to the recipients mentioned above, including recipients located in countries which do not adduce an adequate level of protection from a European (or other non-U.S.) data protection law perspective, for the purposes described above. 
 
 Finally, the Participant understands that the Company may rely on a different legal basis for the processing or transfer of Data in the future and/or request that the Participant provide another data privacy consent. If applicable and upon request of the Company or the Employer, the Participant agrees to provide an executed acknowledgment or data privacy consent form (or any other agreements or consents) that the Company and/or the Employer may deem necessary to obtain from the Participant for the purpose of administering the Participant s participation in the Plan in compliance with the data privacy laws in the Participant s country, either now or in the future. The Participant understands and agrees that he or she will not be able to participate in the Plan if he or she fails to provide any such acknowledgement, agreement or consent requested by the Company and/or the Employer. 
 
 12. 
 Governing Law/Choice of Venue . The Award and the provisions of this Agreement are governed by, and subject to, the laws of the State of Washington, as provided in the Plan, without regard for its conflict of laws provisions. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises under this grant or this Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of Washington, and agree that such litigation shall be conducted exclusively in the courts of King County, or the federal courts of the United States for the 9th Circuit, and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be performed. 
 
 13. 
 Compliance with Law . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the Shares, the Company shall not be required to deliver any Shares issuable upon settlement of the Performance RSUs prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Shares under any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (" SEC ") or of any other governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or approval the Company shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable. The Participant understands that the Company is under no obligation to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Further, the Participant agrees that the Company shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and this Agreement without the Participant s consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws applicable to issuance of Shares. 
 
 14. 
 Language . The Participant acknowledges and represents that he or she is proficient in the English language, or has consulted with an advisor who is sufficiently proficient in English, as to allow the Participant to understand the terms of this Agreement and any other documents related to the Plan.

The Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in the Plan through an online or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company. 
 
 16. 
 Severability . The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. 
 
 17. 
 Undertakings . The Participant hereby agrees to take whatever additional action and execute whatever additional documents the Company may deem necessary or advisable in order to carry out or effect one or more of the obligations or restrictions imposed on either the Participant or the Performance RSUs pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. 
 
 18. 
 No Rights as Shareholder . Except as otherwise provided in Section 2, the Participant will not have dividend, voting or any other rights as a shareholder of the Shares with respect to the Performance RSUs. Upon payment of the vested Performance RSUs in Shares, the Participant will obtain full dividend, voting and other rights as a shareholder of the Company. 

19. 
 Restrictions on Transfer . Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Performance RSUs granted pursuant to this Award may not be sold, pledged (as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose), assigned, hypothecated, transferred, disposed of in exchange for consideration, made subject to attachment or similar proceedings, or otherwise disposed of under any circumstances, except that this Award may be transferred (i) by will or by laws of descent and distribution applicable to a deceased Participant or (ii) pursuant to a domestic relations order. 
 
 20. 
 Appendix A . Notwithstanding any provisions in this Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, the Award of Performance RSUs shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in Appendix A for the Participant s country. Moreover, if the Participant relocates to one of the countries included in Appendix A, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to the Participant, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. Appendix A constitutes part of this Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement. 
 
 21. 
 Imposition of Other Requirements . The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant s participation in the Plan, on the Performance RSUs and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings (as provided in Section 17 above) that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. 
 
 22. 
 Waiver . If the Participant breaches or otherwise does not comply with any provision of this Agreement, but the Company does not act upon this breach or non-compliance and continues to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, this shall not mean that the Company waives any other provision of this Agreement or will otherwise permit any further breach of or non-compliance with any provision of this Agreement. 
 
 23. 
 Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws . Depending on the Participant s country or the country in which Shares are listed, the Participant may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws in applicable jurisdictions, including the United States and, if different, the Participant s country, the Participant s broker s country and/or the country where the Shares are listed, which may affect the Participant s ability directly or indirectly, for the Participant him- or herself or for a third party, to accept, acquire, sell or attempt to sell, or otherwise dispose of Shares, rights to Shares (e.g., Performance RSUs) or rights linked to the value of Shares during such times as the Participant is considered to have "inside information" regarding the Company (as defined by the laws or regulations in the applicable jurisdiction). Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders the Participant placed before possessing inside information. Furthermore, the Participant may be prohibited from (i) disclosing insider information to any third party (other than on a "need to know" basis) and (ii) "tipping" third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities, including third parties who are fellow employees. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company. The Participant acknowledges that it is the Participant s responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and the Participant should consult with the Participant s own personal legal and financial advisors on this matter before taking any action related to the Plan. 
 
 24. 
 Foreign Asset/Account Reporting; Exchange Controls . The Participant s country may have certain foreign asset and/or account reporting requirements and/or exchange controls which may affect the Participant s ability to acquire or hold Shares under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any dividends received or sale proceeds arising from the sale of Shares) in a brokerage or bank account outside the Participant s country. The Participant may be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in the Participant s country. The Participant also may be required to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a result of the Participant s participation in the Plan to the Participant s country through a designated bank or broker and/or within a certain time after receipt. The Participant acknowledges that it is his or her responsibility to comply with such regulations, and the Participant should consult his or her personal legal advisor for any details. 
 
 Finally, the Company hereby strongly recommends that the Participant seek the advice of a personal tax and/or legal advisor to obtain specific information concerning the tax and other legal consequences associated with the Performance RSUs.

APPENDIX A TO 
 STARBUCKS CORPORATION 
 GLOBAL KEY EMPLOYEE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT AGREEMENT 
 2005 LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
 
 Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Appendix A but defined in the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, the Plan or any applicable country-specific sub-plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan, any applicable country-specific sub-plan and/or the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement. 
 
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
 This Appendix A, which is part of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Performance RSUs granted to the Participant under the Plan and that will apply to the Participant if he or she is in one of the countries listed below. 
 
 If the Participant is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries after the Date of Grant, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to what extent the additional terms and conditions included herein will apply to the Participant under these circumstances. 
 
 NOTIFICATIONS 
 
 This Appendix A also includes information regarding exchange control and certain other issues of which the Participant should be aware with respect to his or her participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of August 2019. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that the Participant not rely on the information in this Appendix A as the only source of information relating to the consequences of his or her participation in the Plan because such information may be outdated when the Performance RSUs vest and/or when the Participant sells any Shares acquired at vesting of the Performance RSUs. 
 
 In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to the Participant s particular situation. As a result, the Company is not in a position to assure the Participant of any particular result. The Participant, therefore, should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in his or her country may apply to his or her situation. 
 
 Finally, if the Participant is a citizen or resident or a country other than that in which he or she is currently residing and/or working, is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes or transfers employment and/or residency between countries after the Date of Grant, the information contained herein may not be applicable in the same manner to the Participant. 
 
 AUSTRALIA 
 
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
 Retirement. The Company reserves the right not to apply Section 4.3 of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, in which case, Sections 1, 3 and 4.1 of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement shall be deemed amended, accordingly, such that no references to continued vesting after a termination due to Retirement shall apply to the Performance RSUs. Alternatively, provided the Participant is not subject to taxation in the United States, the Company reserves the right to accelerate the vesting of the Performance RSUs, as of the date the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Retirement, with respect to a number of Performance RSUs determined by the Company at its discretion, in which case, the Award will be payable within sixty (60) days or as soon as practicable following the date the Participant s Active Service terminates. 
 
 Australia Offer Document. The offer of Performance RSUs is intended to comply with the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001, Australian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) Regulatory Guide 49 and ASIC Class Order CO 14/1000. Additional details are set forth in the Offer Document for the offer of Performance RSUs to Australian resident employees, which will be provided to the Participant with this Agreement. 
 
 Compliance with Law. Notwithstanding anything in the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement or the Plan to the contrary, the Participant will not be entitled to, and shall not claim, any benefit under the Plan if the provision of such benefit would give rise to a breach of Part 2D.2 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), any other provision of that Act, or 

any other applicable statute, rule or regulation which limits or restricts the giving of such benefits. Further, the Employer is under no obligation to seek or obtain the approval of its shareholders in general meeting for the purpose of overcoming any such limitation or restriction. 
 
 NOTIFICATIONS 
 
 Tax Information. The Plan is a plan to which subdivision 83A-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) applies (subject to conditions in the Act). 
 
 Exchange Control Information. Exchange control reporting is required for cash transactions exceeding AUD 10,000 and for international fund transfers. If an Australian bank is assisting with the transaction, the bank will file the report on behalf of the Participant. 
 
 CANADA 
 
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
 Termination of Active Status. The following provision replaces Section 5(1) of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement. 
 
 Except as expressly required by applicable legislation, the Participant s Active Status shall be considered terminated as of the date that is the earlier of (a) the date that the Participant receives notice of termination of employment; (b) the date the Participant terminates employment; or (c) the date the Participant is no longer actively employed by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice required under local law (including, but not limited to statutory law, regulatory law and/or common law); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Participant s Active Status shall be considered terminated for purposes of the Performance RSUs (including when the Participant may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence). 
 
 The following provisions apply if the Participant is a resident of Quebec: 
 
 Language Consent. The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that this Agreement, as well as all documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English. 
 
 Les parties reconnaissent avoir expressement souhait que cette Convention, ainsi que tous les documents, avis et proc dures judiciaries, xecut s, donn s ou intent s en vertu de, ou li , directement ou indirectement la pr sente convention, soient r dig s en langue anglaise. 
 
 Data Privacy Notice and Consent. The following provision supplements the Data Privacy section of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement: 
 
 The Participant hereby authorizes the Company and the Company s representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all personnel (professional or not) involved with the administration and operation of the Plan. The Participant further authorizes the Company, any Subsidiary and affiliate and the Employer to disclose and discuss the Participant s participation in the Plan with their advisors. The Participant further authorizes the Company, any Subsidiary and affiliate and the Employer to record such information and to keep it in the Participant s employee file. 
 
 NOTIFICATIONS 
 
 Securities Law Information. The Participant is permitted to sell Shares acquired under the Plan through the designated broker appointed under the Plan, if any, provided that the resale of such Shares takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed (i.e., the NASDAQ Global Select Market). 
 
 Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Foreign specified property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares), options to purchase Shares and other rights to receive Shares (e.g., Performance RSUs) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of his or her foreign specified property exceeds C 100,000 at any time during the year. Thus, Performance RSUs likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C 100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of other foreign specified property the Participant holds. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (" ACB ") of the Shares. The ACB 

ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if the Participant owns other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares. The Participant should consult with a personal tax advisor to ensure compliance with the applicable reporting obligations. 
 
 CHINA 
 
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
 Acceptance of Award. The Participant must log on to the Fidelity website and certify his or her Fidelity account as a condition of this Award. If the Participant does not certify his or her Fidelity account in the manner instructed by Fidelity and/or the Company before the first vesting date occurs, the Award will be subject to cancellation at the Company s sole discretion. If the Award is cancelled, the Participant will have no rights to the underlying Shares or any corresponding benefit. 
 
 The following terms and conditions apply only to Participants who are subject to exchange control restrictions in China, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 
 
 Termination of Employment; Change of Control. The following provision supplements the Termination of Employment; Change of Control section of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement: 
 
 Due to legal restrictions in China, the Participant agrees that the Company reserves the right to require the automatic sale of any Shares acquired at vesting of the Performance RSUs upon the termination of the Participant s Active Status for any reason, including without limitation, voluntary termination by the Participant, termination because of the Participant s Retirement, Disability or death or termination by the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company because of Misconduct. The Participant hereby authorizes the sale of all Shares issued to him or her as soon as administratively practicable after the applicable termination of Active Status and pursuant to this authorization. The Participant further agrees that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such Shares and the Participant expressly authorizes the Company s designated broker to complete the sale of such Shares. The Participant acknowledges that the Company s designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the Shares at any particular price. Upon the sale of Shares, the Participant will receive the sale proceeds less any amounts necessary to satisfy Tax-Related Items and applicable transaction fees or commissions. Due to currency exchange conversion rate fluctuation between the applicable vesting date of the Performance RSUs and (if later) the date on which the Shares are sold, the amount of sale proceeds may be more or less than the fair market value of the Shares on the applicable vesting date (which is the relevant amount for purposes of calculating amounts necessary to satisfy applicable Tax-Related Items). 
 
 Furthermore, the Company reserves the right not to apply Section 4.3 of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, in which case, Sections 1, 3 and 4.1 of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement shall be deemed amended, accordingly, such that no references to continued vesting after a termination due to Retirement shall apply to the Performance RSUs. Alternatively, provided the Participant is not subject to taxation in the United States, the Company reserves the right to accelerate the vesting of the Performance RSUs, as of the date the Participant s Active Status terminates due to Retirement, with respect to a number of Performance RSUs determined by the Company at its discretion, in which case, the Award will be payable within sixty (60) days or as soon as practicable following the date the Participant s Active Service terminates. 
 
 Exchange Control Restriction. Due to exchange control laws and regulations in China, the Participant will be required immediately to repatriate to China the cash proceeds from the sale of Shares and any cash dividends paid on such Shares. The Participant further understands that, under local law, such repatriation of the cash proceeds may need to be effectuated through a special exchange control account established by the Company or a Subsidiary expressly for this purpose. By accepting the Performance RSUs, the Participant agrees that any cash proceeds from the sale of Shares or the receipt of any dividends may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to the Participant. The proceeds may be paid to the Participant in U.S. dollars or in local currency at the Company s discretion. If the proceeds are paid in U.S. dollars, the Participant understands that he or she will be required to open a U.S. dollar bank account in China and provide the bank account details to the Company or the Employer. The Participant acknowledges that, if the cash proceeds are paid in local currency, the Company is under no obligation to secure any particular currency exchange conversion rate. Furthermore, compliance with local exchange control laws and regulations may delay the conversion of cash proceeds into local currency. The Participant agrees that, if the conversion of the cash proceeds into local currency is delayed, he or she shall bear the risk of any currency exchange conversion rate fluctuation between the date on which the Shares issued at vesting of the Performance RSUs are sold or the cash dividend is paid and the date of conversion of the cash proceeds into local currency. The Participant further agrees to comply with any other requirements that the Company may impose in the future in order to facilitate compliance with exchange control requirements in China. 

NOTIFICATIONS 
 
 Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. T he Participant may be required to report to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange all details of his or her foreign financial assets and liabilities, as well as details of any economic transactions conducted with non-China residents. Under these rules, the Participant may be subject to reporting obligations for the Performance RSUs, Shares acquired under the Plan and Plan-related transactions. The Participant should consult with a personal tax advisor in this regard.

The Participant should consult with his or her personal tax advisor as to whether the reporting obligation applies to the Participant and whether the Participant will be required to report details of his or her Performance RSUs, as well as the Shares, in the report. 
 
 NETHERLANDS 
 
 There are no country-specific provisions. 
 
 SINGAPORE 
 
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

("SFA") or pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions of, any other applicable provisions of the SFA.

These notification requirements apply regardless of whether the CEO or directors are residents of or employed in Singapore. 
 
 SWITZERLAND 
 
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The Company reserves the right not to apply Section 4.3 of the Global Leadership Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, in which case Sections 1, 3 and 4.1 of the Leadership RSU Agreement shall be deemed amended, accordingly, such that no references to continued vesting after a termination due to Retirement shall apply to the Performance RSUs. 
 
 NOTIFICATIONS

 Without limitation to the Responsibility for Taxes section of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement, the Participant agrees that he or she is liable for all Tax-Related Items and hereby covenants to pay all such Tax-Related Items as and when requested by the Company or the Employer or by Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs (" HMRC ") (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority). The Participant also agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified the Company and the Employer against any Tax-Related Items that they are required to pay or withhold on the Participant s behalf or have paid or will pay to HMRC (or any other tax authority or any other relevant authority) on the Participant s behalf. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an executive officer or director of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), the Participant acknowledges that he or she may not be able to indemnify the Company or the Employer for the amount of any income tax not collected from or paid by the Participant, as it may be considered a loan. In this case, the amount of any income tax not collected within ninety (90) days of the end of the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the Tax-Related Item(s) occurs may constitute a benefit to the Participant on which additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions (" NICs ") may be payable. The Participant understands that he or she will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for paying to the Company and/or the Employer (as appropriate) the amount of any NICs due on this additional benefit, which may also be recovered from the Participant at any time by any of the means referred to in the Responsibility for Taxes section of the Global Key Employee Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreement.
