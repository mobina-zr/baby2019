Item 1. Business 
 OVERVIEW 
 Spire Inc. Spire or the Company was formed in 2000 and is the holding company for Spire Missouri Inc. Spire Missouri ), Spire Alabama Inc. Spire Alabama ), other gas utilities, and gas-related businesses. Spire Missouri was formed in 1857 and Spire Alabama was formed in 1948 by the merger of two gas companies. Spire is committed to transforming its business and pursuing growth through growing organically, investing in infrastructure, and advancing through innovation. The Company has two key business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. 
 The Gas Utility segment includes the regulated operations of Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf Inc. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi Inc. Spire Mississippi (collectively, the Utilities ). The business of the Utilities is subject to seasonal fluctuations with the peak period occurring in the winter heating season, typically November through April of each fiscal year. Spire Missouri is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas, with primary offices located in St. Louis, Missouri. Spire Missouri is the largest natural gas distribution utility system in Missouri, serving approximately 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers. For utility regulatory purposes, Spire Missouri has two regions (the Missouri Utilities ), one serving St. Louis and eastern Missouri Spire Missouri East and the other serving Kansas City and western Missouri Spire Missouri West ). Spire Alabama is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas principally in central and northern Alabama, serving more than 0.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers with primary offices located in Birmingham, Alabama. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to 0.1 million customers in southern Alabama and south-central Mississippi. 
 The Gas Marketing segment includes Spire Marketing Inc. Spire Marketing ), a wholly owned subsidiary providing natural gas marketing services. 
 As of September 30, 2019, Spire had 3,536 employees, including 2,389 for Spire Missouri and 941 for Spire Alabama. 
 Spire uses its website, SpireEnergy.com, as a routine channel for distribution of important information including news releases, analyst presentations and financial information. The information Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama file or furnish to the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and their amendments, and proxy statements are available free of charge under Filings & reports in the Investors section of Spire s website, SpireEnergy.com, as soon as reasonably practical after the information is filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information contained on Spire s website is not incorporated by reference in this report. The SEC also maintains a website that contains our SEC filings (sec.gov). 
 GAS UTILITY 
 Natural Gas Supply 
 The Utilities fundamental gas supply strategy is to meet the two-fold objective of 1) ensuring a dependable gas supply is available for delivery when needed and 2) insofar as is compatible with that dependability, purchasing gas that is economically priced. In structuring their natural gas supply portfolio, the Utilities focus on natural gas assets that are strategically positioned to meet the Utilities primary objectives. 
 4 

Spire Missouri focuses its gas supply portfolio around a number of large natural gas suppliers with equity ownership or control of assets strategically situated to complement its regionally diverse firm transportation arrangements. Spire Missouri East utilizes both Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast gas sources to provide a level of supply diversity that facilitates the optimization of pricing differentials as well as protecting against the potential of regional supply disruptions. Further, Spire STL Pipeline, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire, is capable of delivering up to 4 million therms per day of natural gas into eastern Missouri , of which Spire Missouri East is the foundation shipper with a contractual commitment of 3.5 million therms per day . Spire Missouri West utilizes low cost gas supply from the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain producing regions . 
 In fiscal year 2019, Spire Missouri purchased natural gas from 26 different suppliers to meet its total service area current gas sales and storage injection requirements. Spire Missouri entered into firm agreements with suppliers including major producers and marketers providing flexibility to meet the temperature-sensitive needs of its customers. Natural gas purchased by Spire Missouri for delivery to its service area through the Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC (MRT) system totaled 50.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf). Spire Missouri also holds firm transportation arrangements on several other interstate pipeline systems that provide access to gas supplies upstream of MRT. In addition to natural gas deliveries from MRT, 58.2 Bcf was purchased on the Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. Southern Star ), 6.2 Bcf was purchased on the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC (TIGT) system, 12.4 Bcf was purchased on the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP (PEPL) system, and 0.5 Bcf was purchased on the Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC (REX) system. Some of Spire Missouri s commercial and industrial customers purchased their own gas with Spire Missouri transporting 47.3 Bcf to them through its distribution system. 
 The fiscal year 2019 peak day send out of natural gas to Spire Missouri customers, including transportation customers, occurred on January 30, 2019. The average temperature was 5 degrees Fahrenheit in St. Louis and 4 degrees Fahrenheit in Kansas City. On that day, the Missouri Utilities customers consumed 1.81 Bcf of natural gas. For eastern Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to St. Louis through the MRT, MoGas Pipeline LLC, and Southern Star transportation systems, and from Spire Missouri s on-system storage and peak shaving resources. For western Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to Kansas City through the Southern Star, PEPL, TIGT, and REX transportation systems. 
 Spire Alabama s distribution system is connected to two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems, Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. Southern Natural Gas and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC Transco ). It is also connected to two intrastate natural gas pipeline systems. 
 Spire Alabama purchases natural gas from various natural gas producers and marketers. Certain volumes are purchased under firm contractual commitments with other volumes purchased on a spot market basis. The purchased volumes are delivered to Spire Alabama s system using a variety of firm transportation, interruptible transportation and storage capacity arrangements designed to meet the system s varying levels of demand. 
 In fiscal 2019, Spire Alabama purchased natural gas from 15 different suppliers to meet current gas sales, storage injection, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction requirements, of which five are under long-term supply agreements. Approximately 69.0 Bcf was transported by Southern Natural Gas, 5.9 Bcf by Transco, and 6.5 Bcf through intrastate pipelines to the Spire Alabama delivery points for its residential, commercial, and industrial customers. 
 The fiscal 2019 peak day send out for Spire Alabama was 0.5 Bcf on November 15, 2018, when the average temperature was 32 degrees Fahrenheit in Birmingham, of which 100 was met with supplies transported through Southern Natural Gas, Transco, intrastate facilities, and one of the four LNG peak shaving facilities. 
 Spire Gulf s distribution system is directly connected to interstate pipelines, natural gas processing plants and gas storage facilities. Spire Gulf buys from a variety of producers and marketers, with BP Energy Company being the primary supplier. 
 5 

Natural Gas Storage 
 Spire Missouri believes that it has ample storage capacity to meet the demands of its distribution system, particularly to augment its supply during peak demand periods. Spire Missouri has a contractual right to store 21.6 Bcf of gas in MRT s storage facility located in Unionville, Louisiana, 16.3 Bcf of gas storage in Southern Star s system storage facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma, and 1.4 Bcf of firm storage on PEPL s system storage. MRT s tariffs allow injections into storage from May 16 through November 15 and require the withdrawal from storage of all but 2.1 Bcf from November 16 through May 15. Southern Star tariffs allow both injections and withdrawals into storage year round with ratchets that restrict the associated flows dependent upon the underlying inventory level per the contracts. 
 In addition, Spire Missouri East supplements pipeline gas with natural gas withdrawn from its own underground storage field located in St. Louis and St. Charles Counties in Missouri. The field is designed to provide approximately 0.3 Bcf of natural gas withdrawals on a peak day and maximum annual net withdrawals of approximately 4.0 Bcf of natural gas based on the inventory level that Spire Missouri plans to maintain. 
 Spire Alabama has a contractual right to store 12.5 Bcf of gas with Southern Natural Gas, 0.2 Bcf of gas with Transco and 0.2 Bcf of gas with Tennessee Gas Pipeline. In addition, Spire Alabama has 1.8 Bcf of LNG storage that can provide the system with up to an additional 0.2 Bcf of natural gas daily to meet peak day demand. 
 Spire Gulf obtains adequate storage capacity through Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, and Enstor Gas, LLC s Bay Gas Storage. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 For details on regulatory matters, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 Other Pertinent Matters 
 Spire Missouri is the only distributor of natural gas within its franchised service areas, while Spire Alabama is the main distributor of natural gas in its service areas. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have franchises in nearly all the communities where they provide service with terms varying from five years to an indefinite duration. A franchise is essentially a municipal permit to install pipes and construct other facilities in the community. All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s current public utility businesses in their respective states. In recent years, although certain franchise agreements have expired, Spire Missouri has continued to provide service in those communities without formal franchises. 
 The principal competition for the Utilities comes from the local electric companies. Other competitors in the service areas include suppliers of fuel oil, coal, and propane, as well as natural gas pipelines that can directly connect to large volume customers. Coal has been price competitive as a fuel source for very large boiler plant loads, but environmental requirements have shifted the economic advantage to natural gas. Oil and propane can be used to fuel boiler loads and certain direct-fired process applications, but these fuels require on-site storage, thus limiting their competitiveness. Competition also comes from district steam systems in the downtown areas of both St. Louis and Kansas City and from municipally or publicly owned natural gas distributors located adjacent to the Alabama service territory. 
 Residential, commercial, and industrial customers represent approximately 95 and 81 of fiscal 2019 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Given the current level of natural gas supply and market conditions, the Utilities believe that the relative comparison of natural gas equipment and operating costs with those of competitive fuels will not change significantly in the foreseeable future, and that these markets will continue to be supplied by natural gas. In new multi-family and commercial rental markets, the Utilities competitive exposures are presently limited to space and water heating applications.

Transportation customers represent approximately 3 and 15 of fiscal 2019 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Spire Missouri offers gas transportation service to its large-user industrial and commercial customers. The tariff approved for that type of service produces a margin similar to that which the Missouri Utilities would have received under their regular sales rates. Spire Alabama s transportation tariff allows it to transport gas for large commercial and industrial customers rather than buying and reselling it to them and is based on Spire Alabama s sales profit margin so that operating margins are unaffected. During fiscal 2019 , substantially all of Spire Alabama s large commercial and industrial customer deliveries involved the transportation of customer-owned gas. 
 The Utilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that, to date, have not materially affected the Utilities or the Company s financial position and results of operations. For a detailed discussion of environmental matters, see Note 16 , Commitment and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 Union Agreements 
 The Company believes labor relations with its employees are good. Should that condition change, the Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions that could negatively impact the Company s results of operations and cash flows.

 GAS MARKETING 
 Spire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and providing energy services to both on-system utility transportation customers and customers outside of the Utilities traditional service areas. The majority of Spire Marketing s business is derived from the procurement and physical delivery of natural gas to a diverse customer base. During fiscal 2019, Spire Marketing utilized over 43 interstate and intrastate pipelines and over 125 suppliers to market natural gas to more than 250 retail customers and 120 wholesale customers, primarily in the central and southern U.S. Through its retail operations, Spire Marketing offers natural gas marketing services to large commercial and industrial customers, while its wholesale business consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, municipalities, storage operators, and utility companies. Wholesale activities currently represent a majority of the total Gas Marketing business. 
 In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into agreements to purchase natural gas at a future date in order to lock up supply to cover future sales commitments to its customers. To secure access to the markets it serves, Spire Marketing contracts for transportation capacity on various pipelines from both pipeline companies directly and, through the secondary capacity market, third parties. Throughout fiscal 2019, Spire Marketing held approximately 1.1 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity. In addition, to ensure reliability of service and to provide operational flexibility, Spire Marketing enters into firm storage contracts and interruptible park and loan transactions with various companies, where it is able to buy and retain gas to be delivered at a future date, at which time it sells the natural gas to third parties. As of September 30, 2019, Spire Marketing has contracted for approximately 20 Bcf of such storage and park and loan capacity for the 2019-2020 winter season. 
 8 

The Gas Marketing strategy is to leverage its market expertise and risk management skills to manage and optimize the value of its portfolio of commodity, transportation, park and loan, and storage contracts while controlling costs and acting on new marketplace opportunities. Overall, Gas Marketing saw significant volume growth in fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of increased business with producers and integrated utilities, retail and wholesale customer growth, and increased optimization opportunities resulting from its overall portfolio of assets.

 Other components of the Company s consolidated information include: 

unallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs 

Spire STL Pipeline LLC Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage West LLC Spire Storage ), described below and 

Spire s subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline, the compression of natural gas, and risk management, among other activities. 

 Spire STL Pipeline is a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire which owns and operates a 65-mile pipeline connecting the Rockies Express Pipeline in Scott County, Illinois, to delivery points in St. Louis County, Missouri, including Spire Missouri s storage facility. The pipeline is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is capable of delivering up to 4 million therms per day of natural gas into eastern Missouri. Spire Missouri is the foundation shipper with a contractual commitment of 3.5 million therms per day. The pipeline was primarily constructed during fiscal 2019. In November 2019, Spire STL Pipeline received final authorization from FERC and placed the pipeline into service. 
 Spire Storage is engaged in the storage of natural gas in the Western region of the United States. It consists of two adjacent storage facilities from the Ryckman Creek and Clear Creek purchases in December 2017 and May 2018, respectively. Spire Storage filed an application with the FERC to operate both facilities in an integrated fashion under a single market rate-based tariff, which the FERC approved seven months later on January 25, 2019. The timing of FERC approvals and other regulatory approvals, our ongoing analysis of the fields geological capabilities and the investments we are making to ensure reliable operations for the upcoming winter, have lengthened the time required to finalize our development approach and achieve sustained profitability. We anticipate investing additional capital through the winter heating season of 2019-2020 as we complete those efforts and serve our existing customers. Future development of Spire Storage would entail additional investments to increase injection, withdrawal and storage capacity and enhance connectivity within the facilities and with interconnected interstate pipelines.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Spire s and the Utilities business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. The risks described below are those the Company and the Utilities consider to be material. When considering any investment in Spire or the Utilities securities, investors should carefully consider the following information, as well as information contained in the caption Forward-Looking Statements, Item 7A, and other documents Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama file with the SEC. This list is not exhaustive, and Spire s and the Utilities respective management places no priority or likelihood based on the risk descriptions, order of presentation or grouping by subsidiary. All references to dollar amounts are in millions. 
 RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO THE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS OF SPIRE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES 
 As a holding company, Spire depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations. 
 Spire is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its operating subsidiaries and cash investments. Spire, and Spire Missouri prior to the holding company s formation in 2000, has paid common stock dividends continuously since 1946. Spire s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to pay upstream dividends and make loans or loan repayments. In addition, because it is a holding company and the substantial portion of its assets are represented by its holdings in the Utilities, the risks faced by the Utilities as described below under RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT may also adversely affect Spire s cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A downgrade in Spire s and/or its subsidiaries credit ratings may negatively affect its ability to access capital and its cost of capital. 
 Currently, Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have investment grade credit ratings. There is no assurance that such credit ratings for any of the Spire companies will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Spire has a working capital line of credit to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Spire s line of credit may be used to meet the liquidity needs of any of its subsidiaries, subject to sublimits. If the rating agencies lowered the credit rating at any of these entities, particularly below investment grade, it might significantly limit that entity s ability to secure new or additional credit facilities and would increase its costs of borrowing. Spire s or the Utilities ability to borrow under current or new credit facilities and costs of that borrowing have a direct impact on their ability to execute their operating strategies. 
 Unexpected losses may adversely affect Spire s or its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. 
 As with most businesses, there are operations and business risks inherent in the activities of Spire s subsidiaries. If, in the normal course of business, Spire or any of its subsidiaries becomes a party to litigation, such litigation could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties or be resolved on unfavorable terms. In accordance with customary practice, Spire and its subsidiaries maintain insurance against a significant portion of, but not all, risks and losses. In addition, in the normal course of its operations, Spire and its subsidiaries may be exposed to loss from other sources, such as bad debt expense or the failure of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. Spire and its operating companies employ many strategies to gain assurance that such risks are appropriately managed, mitigated, or insured, as appropriate. To the extent a loss is not fully covered by insurance or other risk mitigation strategies, that loss could adversely affect the Company s and/or its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. 
 10 

Increased dependence on technology may hinder Spire s and its subsidiaries business operations and adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail. 
 Spire and its subsidiaries have implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including Spire and its subsidiaries integrated planning, scheduling and dispatching of field resources, its automated meter reading system, customer care and billing, procurement and accounts payable, operational plant logistics, management reporting, and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company s or its subsidiaries inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and, to the extent not covered by insurance, could adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations. 
 Although the Company and its subsidiaries have, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into their computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts to date would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies or the Utilities use of such technologies. 
 A cyberattack may disrupt Spire s operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to cybersecurity risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries, or its third-party vendors in the normal course of business, as well as breaches in the technology that manages natural gas distribution operations and other business processes. A loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other technology business tools could adversely affect the Company s and its subsidiaries reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, and subject the Company and its subsidiaries to possible financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on the Company s and its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Company acknowledges that increased dependence on technology increases the Company s exposure to cyberattack. The Company and its subsidiaries closely monitor both preventive and detective measures to manage these risks and maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the Company s and its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. 
 Resources expended to pursue or integrate business acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements may adversely affect Spire s financial position and results of operations and return on investments made may not meet the Company s expectations. 
 From time to time, Spire may seek to grow through strategic acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements. Attractive acquisition and investment opportunities may be difficult to complete on economically acceptable terms. It is possible for Spire to expend considerable resources pursuing acquisitions and investments but, for a variety of reasons, decide not to move forward. Similarly, investment opportunities may be hindered or halted by regulatory or legal actions. To the extent that acquisitions or investments are made, such transactions involve a number of risks, including but not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of management s attention from daily operations, difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees, securing adequate capital to support the transaction, and regulatory approval. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets and there is a possibility that anticipated operating and financial efficiencies expected to result from an acquisition or investment do not develop. Additionally, there are no assurances that resources expended will achieve their intended result. 
 11 

The failure to complete an acquisition successfully or to integrate acquisitions or investments it may undertake could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations and the market s perception of the Company s execution of its strategy. To the extent Spire engages in any of the above activities together with or through one or more of its subsidiaries, including the Utilities, such subsidiaries may face the same risks. 
 Pipeline safety integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on the Company . 
 The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in high consequence areas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As the operator of the STL Pipeline, the Company is required to: 

perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity 

identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area 

improve data collection, integration and analysis 

repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary and 

implement preventative and mitigating actions. 

 The Company is required to maintain pipeline integrity testing programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. Should the Company fail to comply with applicable statutes and the PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety s rules and related regulations and orders, it could be subject to significant penalties and fines. 
 Reductions in capacity of interconnecting, third-party pipelines could cause a reduction in volumes transported by Spire STL Pipeline, which could adversely affect the Company. 
 Spire STL Pipeline is dependent upon third-party pipelines and other facilities to provide delivery options to and from its pipeline. If any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, Spire STL Pipeline s ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, and to the extent not mitigated by contractual indemnification, insurance or tariffs, would thereby reduce its revenues. Any permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect that causes a material reduction in volumes transported on its pipeline could result in an impairment loss that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and operating results. 
 The Company s natural gas storage business includes inherent geologic and operational risks, as well as risks from competition and changes in market fundamentals. 
 In 2017 and 2018, the Company acquired two neighboring storage facilities, one of which had been operating in bankruptcy for an extended period. The Company has restructured to integrate these facilities into one, now known as Spire Storage, to increase capacity, improve operating performance, and improve the integrity of its storage fields and associated above-ground facilities. Any damage to the storage facility or pipelines, or lack of integrity to its storage fields, to the extent not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 
 The Company s storage assets are connected to third-party-owned pipelines. The continuing operation of such third-party pipelines is not within its control. If any of these pipelines become unable to transport, treat or process natural gas or natural gas liquids, or if the volumes it gathers or transports do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines, the Company s revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 The Company does not own all the land on which our storage facilities were constructed, and it is, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessary land use, if and when applicable property rights expire or are renewed. Changes in the terms of such land use could have an adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the Company s storage business. 
 12 

Spire Storage is subject to competition from similar services provided by pipelines and from competing independent storage providers capable of serving our customers. Natural gas storage is a competitive business, with competitors having the ability to expand or build new storage capacity. Increased competition in the natural gas storage business could reduce the demand for the Company s natural gas storage services and drive rates down for its storage business. 
 Storage businesses are affected by various gas market fundamentals which impact the level of demand for storage services and the rates that can be charged for these services. These market fundamentals include: seasonal price spread monthly, daily and hourly price volatility locational basis for pricing points on pipelines connected to a storage facility seasonal, daily and hourly weather and operational impacts in supply and market areas served by a storage facility and its connected pipelines. These fundamentals have varying and potentially material adverse impacts on the various services offered by storage facilities and the rates that can be charged for these services in the market. These services include: long-term firm storage short-term park and loan wheeling and optimization. Rates below the variable costs to operate a storage facility could result in a decision to not operate all of the capacity in the facility or to operate the facility at a loss if required to fulfill firm customer contract obligations. A sustained decline in these rates or a shut-in of all or a portion of one or more facilities capacity could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Transporting, distributing, and storing natural gas and propane involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. 
 Natural gas transportation, distribution and storage activities inherently involve a variety of hazards and operations risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, damage caused by third parties, and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to the Company and its subsidiaries. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Similar risks also exist for Spire Missouri s propane storage, transmission and minor distribution operations. These activities may subject the Company to litigation or administrative proceedings. Such litigation or proceedings could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against the Company and its subsidiaries or be resolved on unfavorable terms. The Utilities and other Spire businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations requiring them to maintain certain safety and system integrity measures by identifying and managing storage and pipeline risks. Compliance with these laws and regulations, or future changes in these laws and regulations, may result in increased capital, operating and other costs which may not be recoverable in a timely manner from customers in rates. In accordance with customary industry practices, the Utilities and other Spire businesses maintain insurance against a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 Workforce risks may affect the Company s financial results. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various workforce risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that it will be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel that it will be unable to effectively transfer to new personnel the knowledge and expertise of an aging workforce as those workers retire and that it will be unable to reach collective bargaining arrangements with the unions that represent certain of its workers, which could result in work stoppages. 
 13 

In connection with acquisitions, Spire and Spire Missouri recorded goodwill and long-lived assets that could become impaired and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. 
 Spire and Spire Missouri assess goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company and Spire Missouri assess their long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets becomes impaired, the Company and Spire Missouri may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations. 
 Since interest rates are a key component, among other assumptions, in the models used to estimate the fair values of the Company s reporting units, rises in interest rates would generally decrease the calculated fair values and future impairments may occur. Due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, Spire and Spire Missouri cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairment. These assumptions and estimates include projected cash flows, current and future rates for contracted capacity, growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples. 
 Changes in accounting standards may adversely impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Spire and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), SEC regulations and other interpretations of financial reporting requirements for public utilities. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial condition or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. The potential issues associated with rate-regulated accounting, along with other potential changes to GAAP that the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continues to consider may be significant. 
 Climate change and regulatory and legislative developments in the energy industry related to climate change may in the future adversely affect operations and financial results. 
 Climate change, and the extent regulatory, public policy, or legislative changes occur to address the potential for climate change, could adversely affect operations and financial results of the Company. Management believes it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. To the extent climate change results in warmer temperatures, financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues and lack of marketing opportunities. Another possible impact of climate change may be more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers. If the Company were unable to deliver natural gas to customers, financial results would be impacted by lost revenues, and the Utilities generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent the Utilities would be unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for the Company s services, the Company s and the Utilities future business, financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted. 
 In addition, there have been a number of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and carbon dioxide. The adoption of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by states or localities, or the adoption of related regulations by federal, state or local governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions or restricting the use of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, in the future could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices charged to customers. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on the Company s and the Utilities future business, financial condition or financial results. 
 14 

Changes to income tax policy, certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could adversely impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Company has significantly reduced its current federal and state income tax obligations over the past few years through tax planning strategies and the extension of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property. As a result, the Company has generated large annual taxable losses that have resulted in significant federal and state net operating losses. The Company plans to utilize these net operating losses in the future to reduce income tax obligations. The value of these net operating losses could be reduced if the Company cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the net operating losses before they expire due to lower than expected financial performance or regulatory actions. 
 Changes to income tax policy, laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes in tax rates, the deductibility of certain expenses including interest and state and local income taxes and/or changes in the deductibility of certain expenditures for property, could adversely impact the Company. Those impacts could include reducing the value of its net operating losses and could result in material charges to earnings. Further, the Company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
 Spire s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to investment and interest rate risk that could negatively impact its financial condition. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries have pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide benefits to many of their employees and retirees. Costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans. The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics. Recessions and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have negatively affected the asset values of Spire s pension plans at various times in the past. Poor investment returns or lower interest rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements, which could have an adverse impact on the Company s and its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. For more information, including regulatory provisions affecting the Utilities plans, see Note 13 , Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 Catastrophic events may adversely affect the Company s facilities and operations. 
 Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, terrorist acts, acts of civil unrest, pandemic illnesses or other similar occurrences could adversely affect the Utilities facilities and operations, as well as those of Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage. The Utilities have emergency planning and training programs in place to respond to events that could cause business interruptions. However, unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on the operations, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. The availability of insurance covering catastrophic events may be limited or may result in higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms . 
 RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT 
 Regulation of the Utilities businesses may impact rates they are able to charge, costs, and profitability. 
 The Utilities are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. At the state level, the Utilities are regulated in Missouri by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC), in Alabama by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC), and in Mississippi by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC). These state public service commissions regulate many aspects of the Utilities distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, the rates the Utilities may charge customers, the terms of service to their customers, transactions with their affiliates, the rate of return they are allowed to realize, and the accounting treatment for certain aspects of their operations. For further discussion of these accounting matters, see Regulatory Accounting under Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7. 
 15 

The MoPSC also approves the Missouri Utilities Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS). The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to replace its worn out or deteriorated infrastructure without the necessity of a formal rate case. Recently , Spire Missouri s recovery of certain ISRS costs have been contested before the MoPSC and the Missouri Court of Appeals. There is risk that any material disallowance of costs could adversely affect revenues. 
 The Utilities ability to obtain and timely implement rate increases and rate supplements to maintain the current rate of return is subject to regulatory review and approval. There can be no assurance that they will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue earning the current authorized rates of return. Spire Alabama s and Spire Gulf s rate setting process, Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE), is subject to regulation by the APSC and is implemented pursuant to APSC orders expiring September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. RSE adjustments would continue after those dates unless the APSC enters an order to the contrary in a manner consistent with the law. Spire Mississippi is subject to regulation by the MSPSC and utilizes the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. For further details, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 The Utilities could incur additional costs if required to adjust to new laws or regulations, revisions to existing laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, as the regulatory environment for the natural gas industry increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance could also increase. If the Utilities fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, whether existing or new, they could be subject to fines, penalties or other enforcement action by the authorities that regulate the Utilities operations. 
 The Utilities are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 The Utilities are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, environmental issues, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. For further details, see Contingencies in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require the Utilities to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in their financial statements, or to the extent they are not covered by insurance, could adversely affect the Utilities results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 The Utilities liquidity may be adversely affected by delays in recovery of their costs, due to regulation. 
 In the normal course of business, there is a lag between when the Utilities incur increases in certain of their costs and the time in which those costs are considered for recovery in the ratemaking process. Cash requirements for increased operating costs, increased funding levels of defined benefit pension and postretirement costs, capital expenditures, and other increases in the costs of doing business can require outlays of cash prior to the authorization of increases in rates charged to customers, as approved by the MoPSC, APSC, and MSPSC. Accordingly, the Utilities liquidity can be adversely impacted to the extent higher costs are not timely recovered from their customers. 
 The Utilities ability to meet their customers natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner. 
 In order to meet their customers annual and seasonal natural gas demands, the Utilities must obtain sufficient supplies, interstate pipeline capacity, and storage capacity. If they are unable to obtain these, either from their suppliers inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, to the extent not mitigated by tariffs, contractual indemnification or insurance, the Utilities financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If a substantial disruption in interstate natural gas pipelines transmission and storage capacity were to occur during periods of heavy demand, the Utilities financial results could be adversely impacted. 
 16 

The Utilities liquidity and, in certain circumstances, the Utilities results of operations may be adversely affected by the cost of purchasing natural gas during periods in which natural gas prices are rising significantly. 
 The tariff rate schedules of the Missouri Utilities, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi contain Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses and Spire Alabama s tariff rate schedule contains a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider that permit the Utilities to file for rate adjustments to recover the cost of purchased gas. Changes in the cost of purchased gas are flowed through to customers and may affect uncollectible amounts and cash flows and can therefore impact the amount of capital resources. 
 Currently, the Missouri Utilities are allowed to adjust the gas cost component of rates up to four times each year while Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf (collectively, the Alabama Utilities and Spire Mississippi may adjust the gas cost component of their rates on a monthly basis. The Missouri Utilities must make a mandatory gas cost adjustment at the beginning of the winter, in November, and during the next twelve months may make up to three additional discretionary gas cost adjustments, so long as each of these adjustments is separated by at least two months. 
 The MoPSC typically approves the Missouri Utilities PGA changes on an interim basis, subject to refund and the outcome of a subsequent audit and prudence review. Due to such review process, there is a risk of a disallowance of full recovery of these costs. Any material disallowance of purchased gas costs would adversely affect revenues. The Alabama Utilities gas supply charges are submitted for APSC review on a monthly basis, regardless of whether there is a request for a change, so prudence review occurs on an ongoing basis. Spire Mississippi s PGA is adjusted on a monthly basis for the most recent charges and is filed at the MSPSC on a monthly basis. 
 Increases in the prices the Utilities charge for gas may also adversely affect revenues because they could lead customers to reduce usage and cause some customers to have trouble paying the resulting higher bills. These higher prices may increase bad debt expenses and ultimately reduce earnings. Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas may result in an increase in short-term debt. 
 To lower financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations, Spire Missouri enters into contracts to hedge the forward commodity price of its natural gas supplies. As part of this strategy, Spire Missouri may use fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, swaps, futures, and option contracts. However, Spire Missouri does not hedge the entire exposure of energy assets or positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Any costs, gains, or losses experienced through hedging procedures, including carrying costs, generally flow through the PGA clause, thereby limiting the Missouri Utilities exposure to earnings volatility. However, variations in the timing of collections of such gas costs under the PGA clause and the effect of cash payments for margin deposits associated with the Missouri Utilities use of natural gas derivative instruments may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. These procedures remain subject to prudence review by the MoPSC. 
 Other than fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, Spire Alabama currently does not utilize risk mitigation strategies that incorporate commodity hedge instruments but has the ability to do so through its GSA. Spire Gulf hedges gas supply for up to 30 months in advance, and Spire Mississippi utilizes hedging for the upcoming heating season. 
 The Utilities business activities are concentrated in three states. 
 The Utilities provide natural gas distribution services to customers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Missouri. Changes in the regional economies, politics, regulations and weather patterns of these states could negatively impact the Utilities growth opportunities and the usage patterns and financial condition of customers and could adversely affect the Utilities earnings, cash flows, and financial position. 
 17 

The Utilities may be adversely affected by economic conditions. 
 Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased energy consumption, particularly by industrial and large commercial companies, a loss of existing customers, fewer new customers especially in newly constructed buildings. As a consequence, national or regional recessions or other downturns in economic activity could adversely affect the Utilities revenues and cash flows or restrict their future growth. Economic conditions in the Utilities service territories may also adversely impact the Utilities ability to collect accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in bad debt expense. 
 Environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures or increase operating costs. 
 The Utilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations. These laws and regulations require the Utilities to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and approvals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may result in costs to the Utilities in the form of fines, penalties or business interruptions, which may be material. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and/or new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the Utilities or their facilities, thereby impacting the Utilities cost of compliance. The discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, including former manufactured gas plant sites, and claims against the Utilities under environmental laws and regulations may result in expenditures and liabilities, which could be material. To the extent environmental compliance costs are not fully covered by insurance or recovered in rates from customers, those costs may have an adverse effect on the Utilities financial condition and results of operations. 
 Because of competition, the Utilities may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which could have an adverse impact on their business, operating results and financial condition. 
 The Utilities face the risk that customers may bypass gas distribution services by gaining distribution directly from interstate pipelines or, in the case of Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf, also from municipally or publicly owned gas distributors located adjacent to its service territory. The Utilities cannot provide any assurance that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The Utilities compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors to those offering delivery only. The Utilities also compete for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally propane and electricity. If they are unable to compete effectively, the Utilities may lose existing customers and/or fail to acquire new customers, which in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on their business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Changes in the wholesale costs of purchased natural gas supplies may adversely impact the Utilities competitive position compared with alternative energy sources. 
 Changes in wholesale natural gas prices compared with prices for electricity, fuel oil, coal, propane, or other energy sources may affect the Utilities retention of natural gas customers and may adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations. 
 18 

Significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions, the effects of climate change, legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to climate change or in support of increased energy efficiency, and other factors that influence customer usage may affect the Utilities sale of heating energy and adversely impact their financial position and results of operations. 
 The Utilities earnings are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. The Missouri Utilities and Spire Mississippi each have a Weather Normalization Adjustment rider, Spire Alabama has a Temperature Adjustment Rider, and Spire Gulf has a Weather Impact Normalization Factor. These mechanisms, approved by the respective state regulatory body, provide better assurance of the recovery of fixed costs and margins during winter months despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather, while the annual rate designs of Alabama and Mississippi help adjust for other factors that affect customer usage. However, significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions in the Utilities service areas and other factors, such as climate change, alternative energy sources and increased efficiency of gas furnaces and other appliances, may result in reduced profitability and decreased cash flows attributable to lower gas sales. Furthermore, continuation of these adjustment factors is subject to regulatory discretion. 
 In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives by the federal, state and local governments addressing greenhouse gas emissions or restricting the use of natural gas could adversely affect customer demand. The promulgation of regulations of the emissions of greenhouse gases and efficiency for residential gas furnaces and other gas appliances or the potential enactment of congressional legislation addressing global warming and climate change may decrease customer usage, encourage fuel switching from gas to other energy forms, and may result in future additional compliance costs that could impact the Utilities financial conditions and results of operations. 
 Regional supply/demand fluctuations and changes in national infrastructure, as well as regulatory discretion, may adversely affect the Missouri Utilities ability to profit from off-system sales and capacity release. 
 The Missouri Utilities income from off-system sales and capacity release is subject to fluctuations in market conditions and changing supply and demand conditions in areas the Missouri Utilities hold pipeline capacity rights. Specific factors impacting the Missouri Utilities income from off-system sales and capacity release include the availability of attractively priced natural gas supply, availability of pipeline capacity, and market demand. Income from off-system sales and capacity release is shared with customers. Effective April 19, 2018, the Missouri Utilities are allowed to retain 25 of the net margins achieved as a result of such off-system sales and capacity releases. The Missouri Utilities ability to retain such income in the future is subject to regulatory discretion in a base rate proceeding. 
 RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS MARKETING SEGMENT 
 Increased competition, fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices, expiration of supply and transportation arrangements, and infrastructure projects may adversely impact the future profitability of Gas Marketing. 
 Competition in the marketplace and fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices have a direct impact on the Gas Marketing business. Changing market conditions and prices, the narrowing of regional and seasonal price differentials and limited future price volatility may adversely impact its sales margins or affect its ability to procure gas supplies and/or to serve certain customers, which may reduce sales profitability and/or increase certain credit requirements caused by reductions in netting capability. Also, Gas Marketing profitability may be impacted by the effects of the expiration, in the normal course of business, of certain of its natural gas supply contracts if those contracts cannot be replaced and/or renewed with arrangements with similar terms and pricing. Although the FERC regulates the interstate transportation of natural gas and establishes the general terms and conditions under which Spire Marketing may use interstate gas pipeline capacity to purchase and transport natural gas, it must occasionally renegotiate its transportation agreements with a concentrated group of pipeline companies. Renegotiated terms of new agreements, or increases in FERC-authorized rates of existing agreements, may impact Gas Marketing s future profitability. Profitability may also be adversely impacted if pipeline capacity or future storage capacity secured is not fully utilized. 
 19 

Reduced access to credit and/or capital markets may prevent the Gas Marketing business from executing operating strategies. 
 The Gas Marketing segment relies on its cash flows, ability to effect net settlements with counterparties, parental guaranties, and access to Spire s liquidity resources to satisfy its credit and working capital requirements. Spire Marketing s ability to rely on parental guaranties is dependent upon Spire s financial condition and credit ratings. If Spire s credit ratings were lowered, particularly below investment grade, counterparty acceptance of parental guaranties may diminish, resulting in decreased availability of credit. Additionally, under such circumstances, certain counterparties may require Spire Marketing to provide prepayments or cash deposits, amounts of which would be dependent upon natural gas market conditions. Reduced access to credit or increased credit requirements, which may also be caused by factors such as higher overall natural gas prices, may limit Spire Marketing s ability to enter into certain transactions. In addition, Spire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with (or are associated with) energy producers, utility companies, and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk in certain individually significant counterparties. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. 
 Risk management policies, including the use of derivative instruments, may not fully protect Spire Marketing s sales and results of operations from volatility and may result in financial losses. 
 In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. 
 Spire Marketing currently manages the commodity price risk associated with fixed-price commitments for the purchase or sale of natural gas by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and/or the Intercontinental Exchange to lock in margins. These exchange-traded/cleared contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. However, market conditions and regional price changes may cause ineffective portions of matched positions to result in financial losses. Additionally, to the extent that Spire Marketing s natural gas contracts are classified as trading activities or do not otherwise qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales designation (or the designation is not elected), the contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value each period. Accordingly, the associated gains and losses are reported directly in earnings and may cause volatility in results of operations. Gains or losses (realized and unrealized) on certain wholesale purchase and sale contracts, consisting of those classified as trading activities, are required to be presented on a net basis (instead of a gross basis) in the statements of consolidated income. Such presentation could result in volatility in the Company s operating revenues. 
 As a natural gas market participant, Spire Marketing is subject to all applicable FERC- and Commodity Futures Trading Commission- (CFTC) administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, including those directed generally to prevent manipulation of or fraud involving natural gas physical transactions and financial instruments, such as futures, options and swaps. Spire Marketing could be subject to substantial penalties and fines by FERC or CFTC, or both, for failure to comply with such rules. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act s swaps regulatory provisions and the related rules may adversely affect our existing derivative contracts and restrict our ability to monetize such contracts, cause us to restructure certain contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks or to optimize assets, increase the costs of entering into and maintaining swaps, adversely affect our ability to execute our hedging strategies and impact the liquidity of certain swaps products, all of which could increase our business costs. 
 20 

Spire Marketing s ability to meet its customers natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies and interstate pipeline services are not available or delivered in a timely manner. 
 Spire Marketing s ability to deliver natural gas to its customers is contingent upon the ability of natural gas producers, other gas marketers, and interstate pipelines to fulfill delivery obligations to Spire Marketing under firm contracts. To the extent that it is unable to obtain the necessary supplies, Spire Marketing s financial position and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
 Regulatory and legislative developments pertaining to the energy industry may adversely impact Gas Marketing s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 The Gas Marketing business is non-regulated, in that the rates it charges its customers are not currently established by or subject to approval by any regulatory body with jurisdiction over its business. However, it is subject to various laws and regulations affecting the energy industry. New regulatory and legislative actions may adversely impact Gas Marketing s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows by potentially reducing customer growth opportunities and/or increasing the costs of doing business. 
 For example, Spire Marketing incurs additional costs to comply with new laws and regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act, which authorizes the CFTC to regulate futures contracts, options and swaps. These derivative transactions include instruments and bilateral contracts that Spire Marketing uses to hedge or mitigate ongoing commercial risks. The Dodd-Frank Act contemplates that most standardized swaps will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the CFTC s rules require companies, including Spire Marketing, to maintain regulatory records of swap transactions, and to report swaps to centralized swap data repositories, among other new compliance obligations. Although Spire Marketing may qualify for exceptions to certain of the new CFTC rules, its derivatives counterparties are subject to new capital, margin, documentation and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. Such new rules may increase transaction costs and may make it more difficult for Spire Marketing to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms or affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available swap counterparties. Spire Marketing s inability to enter into derivatives instruments or other commercial risk hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and expose it to unhedged commercial risks, including potential adverse changes in commodity prices. 
 The CFTC has re-proposed its position limits rules that would modify and expand the applicability of position limits on the amounts of certain speculative futures contracts, as well as economically equivalent options, futures and swaps for or linked to certain physical commodities that market participants may hold, subject to limited exemptions for certain bona fide hedging positions and other types of transactions. To the extent the revised CFTC position limits proposal becomes final, such positions will also be subject to the aggregation rules which the CFTC has adopted and the Company s ability to execute Spire Marketing s hedging strategies described above could be limited if Spire Marketing is unable to qualify for an exemption. It is uncertain at this time whether, when and in what form the CFTC s proposed new position limits rules may become final and effective. 
 The Federal Reserve Board also has proposed rules that would limit certain physical commodity activities of financial holding companies. Such rules, if adopted, may adversely affect Spire Marketing s ability to execute the Company s strategies by restricting the Company s available counterparties for certain types of transactions, limiting the Company s ability to obtain certain services, and reducing liquidity in physical and financial markets. It is uncertain at this time whether, when and in what form the Federal Reserve s proposed rules regarding financial holding companies may become final and effective.

 This section contains the non-GAAP financial measures of net economic earnings (NEE) and net economic earnings per share (NEEPS). NEEPS are calculated by replacing consolidated net income with consolidated NEE in the GAAP diluted earnings per share calculation. Each reconciling item between NEE and net income is shown pre-tax. The income tax effect is calculated by applying federal, state, and local income tax rates applicable to ordinary income to the amounts of the pre-tax reconciling items and then adding any estimated effects of enacted state or local income tax laws for periods before the related effective date. NEEPS for 2016 excludes the impact of the May 2016 equity offering to fund the acquisition of Spire EnergySouth. The weighted-average diluted shares used in the NEEPS calculation for fiscal year 2016 was 43.5, compared to 44.3 used in the GAAP earnings per share calculation.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share and per unit amounts) 
 INTRODUCTION 
 This section analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of Spire Inc. (the Company ), Spire Missouri Inc., and Spire Alabama Inc. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire EnergySouth are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are collectively referred to as the Utilities. The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are Spire Gulf. and Spire Mississippi. This section includes management s view of factors that affect the respective businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, explanations of financial results including changes in earnings and costs from the prior periods, and the effects of such factors on the Company s, Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s overall financial condition and liquidity. Unless otherwise indicated, references to years herein are references to the fiscal years ending September 30 for the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 Reference is made to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 OVERVIEW 
 The Company has two reportable business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. Nearly all of Spire s earnings are derived from its Gas Utility segment, which reflects the regulated activities of the Utilities. Due to the seasonal nature of the Utilities business and the Spire Missouri rate design, earnings of Spire and each of the Utilities are typically concentrated during the heating season of November through April each fiscal year. 
 Gas Utility - Spire Missouri 
 Spire Missouri is Missouri s largest natural gas distribution utility and is regulated by the MoPSC. Spire Missouri serves St. Louis and eastern Missouri through Spire Missouri East and serves Kansas City and western Missouri through Spire Missouri West. Spire Missouri purchases natural gas in the wholesale market from producers and marketers and ships the gas through interstate pipelines into our distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Spire Missouri also transports gas through its distribution system for certain larger customers who buy their own gas on the wholesale market. Spire Missouri delivers natural gas to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the MoPSC. The earnings of Spire Missouri are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. The rate design for each service territory serves to lessen the impact of weather volatility on its customers during cold winters and stabilize Spire Missouri s earnings. 
 On November 19, 2019, the Missouri Western Court of Appeals issued rulings ISRS rulings that determined certain capital investments in 2016 through 2018 were not eligible for recovery under the Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge. The ISRS rulings upheld appeals by the Office of Public Counsel that disallowed recovery of portions of Spire Missouri s ISRS, overturned three prior MoPSC decisions, and ordered refunds to customers of certain amounts deemed not eligible for ISRS recovery. Ultimately, the MoPSC will define its process to enact the decision and the appropriate refund, if any, at a later date should the decision ultimately stand. 
 27 

Spire Missouri strongly disagrees with the ISRS rulings, plans to vigorously defend its position, and is evaluating its legal and regulatory options in response. Spire Missouri has recorded an estimate of the maximum impact of the ISRS rulings based on its interpretation of the rulings and evidence available at the time of this filing. As of September 30, 2019, Spire Missouri recorded an estimated 12.2 regulatory liability for this matter by reducing revenue for the fiscal year ended 2019. There are two components of this provision. The first relates to a 4. 2 refund ordered by the ISRS rulings for amounts collected prior to the last rate case , after which recoveries of related authorized revenues became part of base rates that went into effect in April 2018 . The second component relates to an estimate of 8. 0 for revenues associated with the June 2018 ISRS filing that was approved by the MoPSC in September 2018. The after-tax impact of the provision reduced net income by 9.3, or 0.18 per diluted share. 
 Additional ISRS revenues are currently under appeal related to the January 2019 ISRS filings with annual authorized revenue of 12.4. The estimated amount earned in fiscal year 2019 under this ISRS order was 4.6. Additionally, in future periods Spire Missouri will evaluate the need for an adjustment to the provision based upon new information and further developments. 
 Gas Utility - Spire Alabama 
 Spire Alabama is the largest natural gas distribution utility in the state of Alabama and is regulated by the APSC. Spire Alabama s service territory is located in central and northern Alabama. Among the cities served by Spire Alabama are Birmingham, the center of the largest metropolitan area in the state, and Montgomery, the state capital. Spire Alabama purchases natural gas through interstate and intrastate suppliers and distributes the purchased gas through its distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial and industrial customers and other end-users of natural gas. Spire Alabama also provides transportation services to large industrial and commercial customers located on its distribution system. These transportation customers, using Spire Alabama as their agent or acting on their own, purchase gas directly from marketers or suppliers and arrange for delivery of the gas into the Spire Alabama distribution system. Spire Alabama charges a fee to transport such customer-owned gas through its distribution system to the customers facilities. 
 Gas Utility - Spire EnergySouth 
 Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 100,000 customers in southern Alabama and south-central Mississippi. Spire Gulf is regulated by the APSC, and Spire Mississippi is regulated by the MSPSC. 
 Gas Marketing 
 Spire Marketing Inc. is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis and is reported in the Gas Marketing segment. Spire Marketing markets natural gas across the central and southern U.S. It holds firm transportation and storage contracts in order to effectively manage its transactions with counterparties, which primarily include producers, municipalities, electric and gas utility companies, and large commercial and industrial customers. 
 Other 
 Other components of the Company s consolidated information include: 

unallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs 

Spire STL Pipeline, a subsidiary of Spire which has constructed and, as of November 2019, operates a 65-mile FERC-regulated pipeline to deliver natural gas into eastern Missouri 

Spire Storage, a subsidiary of Spire providing physical natural gas storage services and 

Spire s subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline, the compression of natural gas, and risk management, among other activities. 

 28 

Business Evaluation Factors 
 Based on the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as current economic conditions, management focuses on several key variables in evaluating the financial condition and results of operations and managing the business. 
 For the Gas Utility segment, these include: 

the Utilities ability to recover from their customers the costs of purchasing and distributing natural gas 

the impact of weather and other factors, such as customer conservation, on revenues and expenses 

changes in the regulatory environment at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as decisions by regulators, that impact the Utilities ability to earn the authorized rate of return in each of the service territories they serve 

the Utilities ability to access credit markets and maintain working capital sufficient to meet operating requirements 

the effect of natural gas price volatility on the business and 

the ability to manage costs, integrate and standardize operations, and upgrade infrastructure. 

 In the Gas Marketing segment, these include: 

the risks of competition 

fluctuations in natural gas prices 

the changing flow and availability of natural gas 

new national infrastructure projects 

the ability to procure firm transportation and storage services at reasonable rates 

credit and/or capital market access 

counterparty risks and 

the effect of natural gas price volatility on the business. 

 Further information regarding how management seeks to manage these key variables is discussed below. 
 Gas Utility 
 The Utilities seek to provide reliable natural gas services at a reasonable cost, while maintaining and building secure and dependable infrastructures. The Utilities strategies focus on improving both performance and the ability to recover their authorized distribution costs and rates of return. The Utilities distribution costs are the essential, primarily fixed, expenditures they must incur to operate and maintain more than 58,000 miles of mains and services comprising their natural gas distribution systems and related storage facilities. 
 The Utilities distribution costs include wages and employee benefit costs, depreciation and maintenance expenses, and other regulated utility operating expenses, excluding natural and propane gas expense. Distribution costs are considered in the rate-making process, and recovery of these types of costs is included in revenues generated through the Utilities tariff rates. Spire Missouri s tariff rates are approved by the MoPSC, whereas Spire Alabama s tariff rates are approved by the APSC. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi have tariff rates that are approved by the APSC and MSPSC, respectively. Spire Missouri also has an off-system sales and capacity release income stream that is regulated by tariff but remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. Effective April 19, 2018, customers receive 75 and Spire Missouri receives 25 of the net margins achieved as a result of such off-system sales and capacity releases. Before April 19, 2018, the customer share of such income ranged from 70 to 85 . 
 Some of the factors impacting the level of off-system sales include the availability and cost of Spire Missouri s natural gas supply, the weather in its service area and the weather in other markets. When Spire Missouri s service area experiences warmer-than-normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints, some of Spire Missouri s natural gas supply is available for off-system sales. 
 29 

The Utilities work actively to reduce the impact of wholesale natural gas price volatility on their costs by strategically structuring their natural gas supply portfolios to increase their gas supply availability and pricing alternatives. They may also use derivative instruments to hedge against significant changes in the commodity price of natural gas. Nevertheless, the overall cost of purchased gas remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. The Purchased Gas Adjustment clause of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi and the Gas Supply Adjustment rider of Spire Alabama allow the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the public service commissions, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the use of derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas. As of September 30, 2019 , Spire Missouri had active derivative positions, but Spire Alabama has had no gas supply derivative instrument activity since 2010. The Utilities believe they will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply. The price of natural gas supplies and other economic conditions may affect sales volumes, due to the conservation efforts of customers, and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers. 
 The Utilities rely on short-term credit and long-term capital markets, as well as cash flows from operations, to satisfy their seasonal cash requirements and fund their capital expenditures. The Utilities access the commercial paper market through a program administered by the holding company, which then loans borrowed funds to the Utilities. The Utilities directly access the long-term bond market. Access to debt markets is dependent on current conditions in the credit and capital markets. Management focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and believes the Utilities currently have adequate access to credit and capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources to meet their foreseeable obligations. See the CAPITAL RESOURCES section for additional information. 
 Gas Marketing 
 Spire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and providing energy services to both on-system utility transportation customers and customers outside of the Utilities traditional service areas. Spire Marketing utilizes its natural gas supply agreements, transportation agreements, park and loan agreements, storage agreements and other executory contracts to support a variety of services to its customers at competitive prices. It closely monitors and manages the natural gas commodity price and volatility risks associated with providing such services to its customers through the use of a variety of risk management activities, including the use of exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments and other contractual arrangements. Spire Marketing is committed to managing commodity price risk while it seeks to expand the services that it now provides. Nevertheless, income from the Gas Marketing operations is subject to more fluctuations in market conditions than the Utilities operations. 
 The Gas Marketing business is directly impacted by the effects of competition in the marketplace, the impacts of new infrastructure, surplus natural gas supplies, and the addition of new demand from exports, power generation and industrial load. Spire Marketing s management expects a growing need for marketing services across the country as customers manage seasonal variability and marketplace volatility. 
 In addition to its operating cash flows, Spire Marketing relies on Spire s parental guaranties to secure its purchase and sales obligations of natural gas, and it also has access to Spire s liquidity resources. A large portion of Spire Marketing s receivables are from customers in the energy industry. It also enters into netting arrangements with many of its energy counterparties to reduce overall credit and collateral exposure. On a net dollar exposure basis, approximately 75 of Spire Marketing s customers are utilities or utility affiliates. Although Spire Marketing s uncollectible amounts are closely monitored and have not been significant, increases in uncollectible amounts from customers are possible and could adversely affect Gas Marketing s liquidity and results of operations. 
 30 

Spire Marketing carefully monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its transactions. It performs in-house credit reviews of potential customers and may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit or parental guaranties when appropriate. Credit limits for customers are established and monitored. 
 As a result of infrastructure optimization activities and an abundance of natural gas supply, Spire Marketing cannot be certain that all of its wholesale purchase and sale transactions will settle physically. As such, certain transactions are designated as trading activities for financial reporting purposes, due to their settlement characteristics. Results of operations from trading activities are reported on a net basis in Gas Marketing operating revenues (or expenses, if negative), which may cause volatility in the Company s operating revenues, but have no effect on operating income or net income. 
 In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, some of its purchase and sale transactions are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas is physically delivered, while other energy-related transactions, including those designated as trading activities, are required to be accounted for as derivatives with the changes in their fair value (representing unrealized gains or losses) recorded in earnings in periods prior to settlement. Because related transactions of a purchase and sale strategy may be accounted for differently, there may be timing differences in the recognition of earnings under GAAP and economic earnings realized upon settlement. The Company reports both GAAP and net economic earnings (non-GAAP), as discussed below. 
 NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 Net income, earnings per share and operating income reported by Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are determined in accordance with GAAP. Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama also provide the non-GAAP financial measures of net economic earnings, net economic earnings per share and contribution margin. Management and the Board of Directors use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting, to determine incentive compensation and to evaluate financial performance. These non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, the related GAAP measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages. 
 Net Economic Earnings and Net Economic Earnings Per Share 
 Net economic earnings and net economic earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude from net income the impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities, and the largely non-cash impacts of other non-recurring or unusual items such as certain regulatory, legislative or GAAP standard-setting actions. In fiscal 2019, this included a provision for refunds to customers of amounts previously collected under MoPSC approved orders as a result of the November 2019 ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri. In fiscal 2018, these items included the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the write-off of certain long-standing assets as a result of disallowances in our Missouri rate proceedings. In addition, net economic earnings per share excludes the impact, in the fiscal year of issuance, of shares issued to finance acquisitions that have yet to be included in net economic earnings. 
 31 

The fair value and timing adjustments are made in instances where the accounting treatment differs from what management considers the economic substance of the underlying transaction, including the following: 

Net unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives that are required by GAAP fair value accounting associated with current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. These unrealized gains and losses result primarily from two sources: 

1) 
 
 changes in the fair values of physical and/or financial derivatives prior to the period of settlement and 

2) 
 
 ineffective portions of accounting hedges, required to be recorded in earnings prior to settlement, due to differences in commodity price changes between the locations of the forecasted physical purchase or sale transactions and the locations of the underlying hedge instruments 

Lower of cost or market adjustments to the carrying value of commodity inventories resulting when the net realizable value of the commodity falls below its original cost, to the extent that those commodities are economically hedged and 

Realized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity. 

 These adjustments eliminate the impact of timing differences and the impact of current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in each period until being replaced with the actual gains or losses realized when the associated physical transactions occur. Management believes that excluding the earnings volatility caused by recognizing changes in fair value prior to settlement and other timing differences associated with related purchase and sale transactions provides a useful representation of the economic effects of only the actual settled transactions and their effects on results of operations. While management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate both Spire s Utilities and its other gas-related businesses, the net effect of these fair value and timing adjustments on the Utilities earnings is minimal because gains or losses on their natural gas derivative instruments are deferred pursuant to state regulation. 
 Contribution Margin 
 In addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP measure of contribution margin when evaluating results of operations. Contribution margin is defined as operating revenues less natural and propane gas costs and gross receipts tax expense. The Utilities pass to their customers (subject to prudence review by, as applicable, the MoPSC, APSC or MSPSC) increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of natural gas in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders. The volatility of the wholesale natural gas market results in fluctuations from period to period in the recorded levels of, among other items, revenues and natural gas cost expense. Nevertheless, increases and decreases in the cost of gas associated with system gas sales volumes and gross receipts tax expense (which are calculated as a percentage of revenues), with the same amount (excluding immaterial timing differences) included in revenues, have no direct effect on operating income. Therefore, management believes that contribution margin is a useful supplemental measure, along with the remaining operating expenses, for assessing the Company s and the Utilities performance.

Income tax effect is calculated by applying federal, state and local income tax rates applicable to ordinary income to the amounts of the pre-tax reconciling items and then adding any estimated effects of enacted state or local income tax laws for periods before the related effective date. 

Net economic earnings per share is calculated by replacing consolidated net income with consolidated net economic earnings in the GAAP diluted earnings per share calculation, which includes reductions for cumulative preferred dividends and participating shares.

2019 vs. 2018 
 Consolidated 
 Spire s net income was 184.6 in fiscal 2019, compared with 214.2 in fiscal 2018. Basic and diluted earnings per share were 3.53 and 3.52, respectively, for fiscal 2019 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of 4.35 and 4.33, respectively, for fiscal 2018. The decrease in net income of 29.6 reflects a 12.2 pre-tax 9.3 after-tax) reduction in the current year due to ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri, and a 60.1 prior year income benefit relating to the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), partly offset by 38.4 in pre-tax 23.6 after-tax) expense for Missouri rate case write-offs recorded in the prior year. The TCJA is further described in Note 12 , Income Taxes, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 Excluding these amounts, net income growth was 16.2, driven by higher operating results of the Gas Utility segment primarily attributable to Spire Missouri s new rate design, higher ISRS charges, higher volumes, and customer growth. 
 The Gas Marketing segment also experienced strong operating results, as the benefits of geographic expansion have mostly offset the return of more normal market conditions and higher operating expenses. 
 Net economic earnings were 195.1 3.73 per diluted share) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, up from 183.7 3.72 per diluted share) for the same period last year. Earnings reflect a 16.7 increase for Gas Utility, partly offset by a 3.5 net economic earnings decrease experienced by Gas Marketing and by a 1.8 higher net economic loss in Other. These fluctuations are described in more detail below. Earnings per share and net economic earnings per share were further impacted by the issuance of 2.3 million common shares in May 2018, and the dividends earned from the 250.0 in preferred shares issued in May 2019. Dividends earned on cumulative preferred shares are deducted from net income in the calculation of earnings per share. 
 Gas Utility 
 Gas Utility net income increased by 46.1, while net economic earnings increased 16.7 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Both measures benefited from the 2018 rate case redesign at Spire Missouri, and from weather patterns that were favorable compared to the prior year. Current year net income was negatively impacted by 9.3 in after-tax impacts relating to ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri. Prior-year net income was negatively impacted by the 23.6 after-tax expense related to Missouri rate case write-offs and by a 17.0 one-time tax expense related to the implementation of the TCJA. 
 Gas Marketing 
 The Gas Marketing segment reported net income totaling 18.5 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, versus net income of 24.9 during the same period last year, with the prior-year period benefitting from favorable fair value mark-to-market valuations and unusually favorable market conditions. Net economic earnings for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, was 19.4, a decrease of 3.5 from the same period last year as the benefits of geographic expansion were more than offset by a return of more normal market conditions and higher operating expenses. 
 Other 
 The Company s other non-utility activities generated a net loss of 24.4 for fiscal 2019, compared to net income of 44.9 for the same period last year. Fiscal 2018 reflects a 78.2 tax benefit resulting from the implementation of the TCJA, partly offset by higher acquisition and restructuring activities. Net economic loss was 24.1 for fiscal 2019, an increase of 1.8 compared to fiscal 2018. The increased loss reflects higher corporate interest costs and a 15.4 loss from Spire Storage, partially offset by increased allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) income for Spire STL Pipeline.

 Spire s operating revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 were 12.6 lower than the same period in the prior year. Operating revenues decreased by 27.6 at the Gas Utility segment and were 12.1 higher in the Gas Marketing segment. The Gas Utility decrease was due principally to lower gas cost recoveries, rate case TCJA customer givebacks, impacts at Spire Missouri relating to ISRS rulings, and weather/volumetric impacts (net of volume mitigation) that were only partly offset by Missouri rate design changes, higher ISRS, and favorable Spire Alabama Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) renewal and giveback. The Gas Marketing increase was primarily due to higher volumes that offset the impact of slightly lower pricing. 
 35 

Spire s contribution margin increased 17.9 compared with the same twelve -month period last year. The growth in contribution margin was primarily attributable to the Gas Utility segment, up 19.6 , with the Missouri Utilities up 11.0 and Spire Alabama up 7.0 , with remaining growth from the utilities of Spire EnergySouth. Gas Marketing s contribution margin was down 5.7, reflecting a decline in basis differentials that was only partly offset by higher volumes combined with geographic expansion . Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the Gas Utility segment, driven principally by continued infrastructure investment in both the Missouri Utilities and Spire Alabama. Gas Utility operation and maintenance O&M expenses were lower in the current year driven primarily by the Missouri rate case write-offs in the prior year. These fluctuations are described in more detail below. 
 Gas Utility 
 Operating Revenues Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2019 decreased 27.6 compared to fiscal 2018, and was attributable to the following factors: 

Missouri Utilities and Spire Alabama Lower PGA/GSA gas cost recoveries

(27.6 

As shown in the table above, the decrease in revenues was driven primarily by a 30.2 reduction in gas cost recoveries, rate case TCJA customer givebacks totaling 24.3, 12.4 attributable to volumetric usage, and a 12.2 impact due to ISRS rulings. These impacts were only partly offset by an increase of 32.2 relating to the rate design changes at Spire Missouri, an increase in ISRS of 8.7, a 4.6 increase relating to Spire Alabama s RSE renewal and giveback, and 2.7 attributable to customer growth. 
 Contribution Margin Gas Utility contribution margin was 967.1 for fiscal 2019, a 19.6 increase over the same period last year. The increase was attributable to the following factors: 

Missouri Utilities 2018 rate case resets 

32.2

The increase was primarily attributable to the 32.2 increase resulting from the 2018 Missouri rate cases resets. Contribution margin also benefited from 8.7 higher ISRS charges, 5.1 due to volumes and colder weather in the current year (net of weather mitigation), a 4.6 increase relating to Spire Alabama s RSE renewal and giveback, and 2.7 attributable to customer growth. These positive impacts were only partly offset by rate case TCJA customer givebacks totaling 24.3 from both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, and 12.2 relating to ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri.

Operating Expenses Gas Utility O&M expenses for the twelve months ended September 30 , 2019 decreased 8.0 from last year . Removing last year s 38.4 of Missouri rate case write-offs, and the 19.6 net year-over-year increase due to the transfer of mix of service and non-service postretirement benefits costs to other income and expense , O&M increased 10.8. Of this increase, 9. 0 relates to higher employee benefits and energy efficiency costs that resulted from the 2018 Missouri rate case s . Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30 , 2019 increased 12.4 from the same period last year principally the result of continued infrastructure capital spending , with 8.7 of the increase attributable to Spire Missouri and 3.0 attributable to Spire Alabama. 
 Gas Marketing 
 Operating Revenues Gas Marketing operating revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019 increased 12.1 from the prior year. The variance in revenues reflects the effect of a 9.3 favorable mark-to-market adjustment on derivatives combined with higher total volumes, partly offset by the impact of marginally lower general pricing levels. Average commodity pricing for the year ended September 30, 2019 was approximately 2.670/MMBtu versus approximately 2.681/MMBtu for fiscal 2018, a decrease of 0.011/MMBtu. 
 Contribution Margin Gas Marketing contribution margin was 35.6 for fiscal 2019, a 5.7 decrease compared to the same period last year. This reflects geographic expansion that created additional opportunities to optimize the segment s supply, transportation and storage portfolio that was more than offset by a return to more normal market conditions, reflected in the narrowed basis differentials in the current year. 
 Other 
 Other operating revenue increased 5.0 for the year ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018, driven principally by gas storage revenues and slightly higher reinsurance premiums. Other operating expenses were 1.3 higher than the prior year primarily due to gas storage operations. 
 Interest Charges 
 Consolidated interest charges during the year ended September 30, 2019 increased 6.0 versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by net long-term debt issuances and higher rates and levels of short-term borrowings. Short-term rates averaged 2.7 in the current year versus 2.0 for the prior year and, for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, average short-term borrowings were 574.5 and 408.6, respectively. Partly offsetting these factors was an increase in the non-cash AFUDC income for Spire STL Pipeline compared to the prior year. 
 Income Taxes 
 Consolidated income tax expense during the year ended September 30, 2019 was 34.5, compared to a 26.5 tax benefit for fiscal 2018. This increase of 61.0 is primarily the result of the 60.1 fiscal 2018 revaluation benefit of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet that were not reflected in net economic earnings. The remaining increase in income tax is primarily the result of the effects of higher pre-tax book income in the current year, partly offset by an increase in amortization of excess deferred income taxes.

Operating revenues during the year ended September 30, 2019 increased 6.2 from the same period last year. Revenues were impacted primarily by the 9.4 increase attributable to the new rate design (net of TCJA giveback), combined with higher ISRS charges of 8.7, and customer growth of 2.7. These positive impacts on the revenue growth were partly offset by 12.2 in impacts relating to ISRS rulings and volume impacts (net of weather mitigation) of 3.6. 
 Contribution margin for the year ended September 30, 2019 increased 11.0 from the prior year. Contribution margin benefited from the 9.4 increase attributable to the new rate design (net of TCJA giveback), combined with higher ISRS charges of 8.7, customer growth of 2.7, and the 2.8 increase due to the combined impacts of volumetric usage and higher off-system sales. These positive impacts were only partly offset by the 12.2 in adjustments relating to the ISRS rulings. 
 O&M expenses for the year ended September 30, 2019 were 11.0 lower than the prior year. Removing last year s 38.4 of Missouri rate case write-offs, and the 16.9 net year-over-year increase due to the transfer of mix of service and non-service postretirement benefits costs to other income and expense, O&M increased 10.5. Of this increase, 9.0 relates to higher employee benefits and energy efficiency costs that resulted from the 2018 Missouri rate cases. Depreciation and amortization increased 8.7, reflecting continued infrastructure investments throughout Missouri. Interest expense in the current year was 2.8 greater than prior year, the result of higher short-term borrowings and higher average effective interest rates. Income taxes were 45.9 higher for the year ended September 30, 2019 versus the prior year. This increase is primarily the result of the 45.2 fiscal 2018 revaluation benefit of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. 
 Temperatures experienced in the Missouri Utilities service area during fiscal 2019 were 5 colder than the prior year and 8 colder than normal. Total system therms sold and transported were 1,805.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with 1,759.8 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of 3 . Total off-system therms sold and transported outside of Spire Missouri s service area decreased 44 to 38.5 million for fiscal 2019 compared with 68.6 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease in off-system therms was the direct result of the increase in demand experienced for system therms.

Operating revenues for the year ended September 30, 2019 decreased 35.2 versus the comparable period ended September 30, 2018. Of the decrease, 27.8 related to lower gas cost recoveries, 8.8 was the result of weather and usage impacts, 1.7 was attributable to lower gross receipt taxes, along with approximately 1.5 associated with rate reductions to customers due to tax savings from the TCJA. Partly offsetting these negative impacts was a 4.6 increase relating to favorable RSE renewal and giveback. 
 Contribution margin increased 7.0 versus the prior year, as a favorable RSE adjustment of approximately 4.6 and a 3.9 increase due to weather/volumetric impacts (net of weather mitigation) were only slightly offset by the 1.5 impact of the customer rate reduction resulting from the TCJA. 
 O&M expenses for the year ended September 30, 2019 increased 3.8 versus the year ended September 30, 2018. Removing the 2.4 net year-over-year increase due to the transfer of mix of service and non-service postretirement benefits costs to other income and expense, O&M increased 1.4. Depreciation and amortization was 3.0 higher versus the same period last year, the result of continued infrastructure investment throughout Spire Alabama s service territory. 
 Interest expense increased 4.4. The increase was primarily driven by net long-term debt issuances and higher rates and levels of short-term borrowings. Income tax expense is 61.1 lower than the prior year, primarily the result of 2018 being burdened with the 60.7 deferred tax revaluation impact resulting from the implementation of the TCJA. 
 Temperatures in Spire Alabama s service area during the year ended September 30, 2019 were 6 warmer than last year, and approximately 6 warmer than historical norms. Spire Alabama s total therms sold and transported were 1,083.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2019, compared with 1,020.8 million last year, a 6 increase.

2018 vs. 2017 
 Consolidated 
 Spire s net income was 214.2 in fiscal 2018, compared with 161.6 in fiscal 2017. Basic and diluted earnings per share were 4.35 and 4.33, respectively, for fiscal 2018 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of 3.44 and 3.43, respectively, for fiscal 2017. Net economic earnings were 183.7 (or 3.72 per share) in fiscal 2018, compared with 167.6 (or 3.56 per share) in fiscal 2017, an increase of 16.1. Net income increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a 67.2 expense decrease from other activities, a 21.5 net income increase in the Gas Marketing segment, offset by a 36.1 net income decline in the Gas Utility segment. For the current year, both net income per share and net economic earnings per share were impacted by 2.3 million shares that were issued May 10, 2018. The key drivers of variances are discussed in detail below. 
 Gas Utility 
 Gas Utility net income decreased by 36.1, while net economic earnings increased 1.6 in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Both measures benefited from weather patterns that were significantly favorable to the prior year, with temperatures in the Utilities territories being near normal, versus 28 wa rmer than normal in the prior year, combined with a lower federal tax rate resulting from the implementation of the TCJA net of amounts reflected in lower customer rates. These favorable impacts were partly offset by the rates changes in the Missouri Utilities effective during the third quarter as a result of two rate cases. Net income was further negatively impacted by the 23.6 after-tax charge related to certain recoveries being disallowed by the MoPSC as a result of those rate case proceedings. 
 Gas Marketing 
 Gas Marketing reported net income totaling 24.9, an increase of 21.5 compared with the same period last year. Net economic earnings for fiscal 2018 increased 16.1 from fiscal 2017. The increase in both net income and net economic earnings was attributable to improved market conditions resulting from colder weather and increased temperature volatility in the current year that increased value from regional basis differentials (spreads) and storage and transportation optimization. Net income also benefited from favorable mark-to-market fair value adjustments and the implementation of the TCJA. Further details are discussed in the Gas Marketing section below. 
 Other 
 The Company s other non-utility activities generated net income of 44.9 for fiscal 2018, compared to a 22.3 net loss for the same period last year. This favorable variance was driven primarily by a 78.2 tax benefit resulting from the implementation of the TCJA, partly offset by higher acquisition and restructuring activities. Net economic loss was 22.3 for fiscal 2018, an increase of 1.6 compared to fiscal 2017. The increased loss reflects higher after-tax interest and other corporate costs, partially offset by an increase in non-cash earnings related to STL Pipeline.

Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses 
 Consolidated 
 Spire reported operating revenues of 1,965.0 for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared with 1,740.7 for the year-ended September 30, 2017. The increase was driven primarily by the Utilities, the result of higher gas costs passed on to customers in both Missouri and Alabama, higher volumetric demand driven principally by colder weather, higher gross receipt taxes, and higher ISRS charges at Spire Missouri. These positive drivers were partly offset by the negative impact of new rates implemented in the Spire Missouri territory in April 2018, lower off-system sales at Spire Missouri, and the timing of return of tax savings to Spire Alabama customers. Spire s contribution margin increased 42.4 for the year ended September 30, 2018, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher contribution margin in the Gas Marketing and Gas Utility segments of 29.7 and 8.5, respectively, combined with an 8.8 increase in contribution margin from the Company s other non-utility activities. O&M expenses increased 75.2 for the year ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the prior year, as discussed below. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 14.3, driven principally by continued infrastructure investment at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama in fiscal 2018. 
 Gas Utility 
 Operating Revenues Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 220.5 compared to fiscal 2017, and was attributable to the following factors: 

Missouri Utilities and Spire Alabama Higher PGA/GSA gas cost recoveries 

149.2 

Missouri Utilities and Spire Alabama Volumetric usage

All other factors 
 
 2.8 

Total Variation 

220.5 

As shown in the table above, Gas Utility revenue posted a year-over-year increase of 220.5. The growth was driven by 149.2 higher gas cost recoveries at both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, 99.3 due to volumetric usage primarily related to colder weather in fiscal 2018, higher gross receipt taxes resulting from the higher current year revenues, growth at Spire EnergySouth and increases due to Spire Missouri customer growth. Partly offsetting these gains were 28.3 in lower off-system sales at Spire Missouri as higher demand for system sales reduced gas availability, the new rate design implementation at Spire Missouri, and customer rate reductions at Spire Alabama due to tax savings from the TCJA. 
 Contribution Margin Gas Utility contribution margin was 947.5 for fiscal 2018, a 8.5 increase over the same period last year. The increase was attributable to the following factors: 

Missouri Utilities and Spire Alabama Volumetric usage 

29.2 

Missouri Utilities Higher ISRS 
 
 5.2 

Missouri Utilities Customer growth

Total Variation 

8.5 

41 

The increase was primarily attributable to the 29.2 increase resulting from higher volumetric usage. Temperatures in the Spire Missouri territory experienced heating degree days that were 29 colder than last year and 3 colder than normal. Heating d egree days in the Spire Alabama service areas in fiscal 2018 were 51 colder than the prior year and were close to normal. Contribution margin also benefited from higher ISRS charges and customer growth at Spire Missouri. These positive impacts were partly offset by a 20.6 reduction at the Missouri Utilities due to the April 2018 implementation of new rates that lowered the fixed monthly charge and increased the volumetric component. This results in the shifting of revenues from the April through October time period to November through March, the period when the highest volume of gas is used by customers. At Spire Alabama, contribution margin was negatively impacted by 11.2 resulting from the timing of rate reductions to customers due to tax savings from the TCJA. 
 Operating Expenses O&M expenses increased 59.8 for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the 36.6 of disallowed recoveries at Spire Missouri resulting from the MoPSC rulings in the rate cases completed in March 2018, O&M expenses were 23.2 above prior year levels due primarily to 15.9 growth at Spire Missouri and 10.6 growth at Spire Alabama, partly offset by a 3.3 reduction experienced by Spire EnergySouth. The O&M growth at the Missouri Utilities and Spire Alabama were attributable to the colder weather, with higher employee-related costs and bad debt expense at both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama in the current year. Spire Missouri was also impacted by a 5.8 increase in pension and postretirement amortization expenses resulting from the rate cases. For more information about the Missouri rate cases, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Taxes other than income taxes were 14.7 higher in the current year, driven by a 15.3 increase related to higher gross receipt taxes due to the higher revenues. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased 13.5 from the prior year, 9.7 due to Spire Missouri and 3.3 relating to Spire Alabama, principally the result of continued infrastructure capital spending in fiscal 2018. 
 Gas Marketing 
 Operating Revenues Gas Marketing operating revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018 decreased 7.7 from the prior year. The variance in revenues reflects the impact of lower general pricing levels, partly offset by the effect of favorable 10.5 mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives and slightly higher total volumes. Average commodity pricing for the year ended September 30, 2018 was approximately 2.680/MMBtu versus approximately 2.897/MMBtu for fiscal 2017, a decrease of 0.217/MMBtu. 
 Contribution Margin Gas Marketing contribution margin was 41.3 for fiscal 2018, a 29.7 increase compared to the same period last year, with that variance significantly impacted by favorable fair value adjustments on derivative holdings in the current year, and unfavorable adjustments in the prior year. Removing these fair value adjustments from both periods, contribution margin is 19.8 higher than last year, reflecting higher storage and transportation optimization, and capturing large basis differentials (spreads) during the cold weather in the current year. 
 Other 
 Other operating revenue increased 8.8 for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to 2017, driven by higher reinsurance premiums and gas storage revenues. Other operating expenses were 19.9 higher than the prior year, with 15.7 of the increase driven by acquisitions of gas storage operations, and the remaining increase due to costs related to the reinsurance premiums. 
 Interest Charges 
 Consolidated interest charges during the year ended September 30, 2018 increased 9.3 versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by Spire Missouri s issuance of 170.0 in long-term debt in September 2017, and Spire Alabama s issuance of 75.0 of long-term debt: 30.0 on December 1, 2017, and 45.0 on January 12, 2018. Also, short-term rates averaged 2.0 in the current year versus 1.2 for the prior year, which was only partly offset with lower average borrowings outstanding. For the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, average short-term borrowings were 408.6 and 485.8, respectively. 
 42 

Income Taxes 
 Consolidated income tax expense during the year ended September 30, 2018, decreased 104.1, primarily as a result of the TCJA enacted in December 2017. Of the decrease, 60.1 is the result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet that were not reflected in net economic earnings. The remaining reduction in income tax is primarily the result of a decrease in current year federal income tax rate due to tax reform, combined with the effects of lower pre-tax book income. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 was (14.1 compared to 32.4 in fiscal 2017.

Operating revenues during the year ended September 30, 2018 increased 113.7 from the same period last year. Revenues were impacted primarily by higher gas costs of 83.7 passed on to customers, a 61.1 increase due to weather and volumetric impacts, higher gross receipts taxes of 8.9, higher ISRS charges of 5.2, and customer growth of 2.6. These positive impacts on the revenue growth were partly offset by a 28.3 reduction in off-system sales and a 20.6 reduction due to the implementation of the two Missouri rate cases that were resolved in March 2018. 
 Contribution margin for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased 6.3 from the prior year. Higher volumetric/weather impacts and ISRS charges of 17.0 and 5.2, respectively, combined with customer growth impacts of 2.6, were partly offset by a 20.6 reduction due to two Missouri rate cases (as noted above). 
 O&M for the year ended September 30, 2018 were 52.5 higher than the prior year. Of this increase, 36.6 was due to disallowed recoveries resulting from the MoPSC rulings in the rate cases completed in March 2018, and 7.0 was primarily related to an increase in the amount of amortization for pension and postretirement costs resulting from those rate cases. Excluding these rate case impacts, O&M increased 8.9, attributable to the colder weather, with higher employee-related costs and bad debt expense in the current year. Depreciation and amortization increased 9.7, reflecting continued infrastructure investments throughout Missouri. Interest expense in the current year was 7.3 greater than prior year, the result of the issuance of 170.0 in long-term debt in September 2017, and the combination of higher short-term borrowings and higher average effective interest rates. Income taxes were 80.1 lower for the year ended September 30, 2018 versus the prior year, as described earlier. 
 Temperatures experienced in the Missouri Utilities service area during fiscal 2018 were 29 colder than they prior year and 3 colder than normal. Total system therms sold and transported were 1,759.8 million for fiscal 2018 compared with 1,482.1 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of 19 . Total off-system therms sold and transported outside of Spire Missouri s service area decreased 61 to 68.6 million for fiscal 2018 compared with 175.6 million for fiscal 2017. The decrease in off-system therms was the direct result of the increase in demand experienced for system therms.

Operating revenues for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased 100.2 versus the comparable period ended September 30, 2017. Of the increase, 65.5 related to higher gas cost recoveries, 38.2 was the result of weather and usage impacts, 6.0 was attributable to higher gross receipt taxes, along with approximately 1.7 associated with lower RSE return on equity revenue adjustments in the current year. Partly offsetting these positive impacts was a 11.2 revenue reduction resulting from the timing of rate reductions to customers due to tax savings from the TCJA. 
 Contribution margin increased 2.8 versus the prior year, as 12.2 in higher weather/volumetric impacts and a favorable RSE adjustment of approximately 1.7 were offset by the 11.2 impact of the customer rate reduction resulting from the TCJA. 
 O&M expenses for the year ended September 30, 2018 increased 10.6 versus the year ended September 30, 2017. The increase in other operating expenses was driven primarily by higher employee-related costs and bad debt, which were unfavorably impacted by the colder weather in the current year and a 4.2 mix impact relating to the transfer of non-service postretirement benefits costs to other income and expense. Depreciation and amortization was 3.3 higher versus the same period last year, the result of continued infrastructure investment throughout Spire Alabama s service territory. 
 Temperatures in Spire Alabama s service area during the year ended September 30, 2018 were 51 colder than last year, and approximately equal to historical norms. Spire Alabama s total therms sold and transported were 1,020.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, compared with 900.6 million last year, a 13 increase.

 REGULATORY MATTERS 
 For discussions of regulatory matters for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Those discussions include more information about the Utilities recent rate proceedings and updates on FERC proceedings related to Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage. 
 ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have evaluated or are in the process of evaluating the impact that recently issued accounting standards will have on their financial position or results of operations upon adoption. For disclosures related to the adoption of new accounting standards, see the New Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 44 

INFLATION 
 The accompanying financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions, regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant. Rate regulation, to which the Utilities are subject, allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation. The Utilities expect to incur significant capital expenditures in future years, primarily related to the planned increased replacements of distribution plant. The Utilities believe any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities will be recovered through the normal regulatory process. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our financial statements: 
 Regulatory Accounting The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations . The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. For Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance: 
 PGA Clause Spire Missouri s PGA clauses allows the Missouri Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to a prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including the costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the Missouri Utilities use of natural gas derivative instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas. The difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period. The PGA clauses also permit the application of carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, and also provide for a portion of income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers. 
 GSA Rider Spire Alabama s rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider, established in 1993, which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama s tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA, that is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama s earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. In prior years, Spire Alabama entered into cash flow derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on its gas supply. Spire Alabama recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Any realized gains or losses are passed through to customers using the mechanisms of the GSA rider in accordance with Spire Alabama s APSC approved tariff and are recognized as a 
 45 

regulatory asset or regulatory liability. All derivative commodity instruments in a gain position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to each related counterparty. Derivative commodity instruments in a loss position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to Spire Alabama. Spire Alabama currently has no active gas supply derivative positions. 
 ISRS The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to replace its worn out or deteriorated infrastructure without the necessity of a formal rate case. Recently, Spire Missouri s recovery of certain ISRS costs have been contested before the MoPSC and the Missouri Court of Appeals. Spire Missouri records ISRS revenues as authorized by the MoPSC and estimates the probability and amount of any refunds based on commission precedent, current legal rulings, the opinion of legal counsel, and other considerations. 
 Employee Benefits and Postretirement Obligations Pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions provided by management related to future events, such as discount rates, returns on plan assets, compensation increases, and mortality rates. For the Utilities, the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs, as discussed further below. Certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers compensation claims, portions of which are self-insured and/or contain stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit exposure, are established based on historical trends. 
 The amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs recognized in the financial statements related to the Utilities qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances, as approved by the MoPSC (for Spire Missouri) and as approved by the APSC (for Spire Alabama). The allowances have been established in the rate-making process for the recovery of these costs from customers. The differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. GAAP also requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs, be reflected in other comprehensive income. For the Utilities qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.

Income Taxes Income tax calculations require estimates due to book-tax differences, estimates with respect to regulatory treatment of certain items, and uncertainty in the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Critical assumptions and judgments also include projections of future taxable income to determine the ability to utilize net operating losses and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management regularly assesses financial statement tax provisions to identify any change in regulatory treatment or tax related estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations. 
 For further discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 LIQUIDITY 
 The Company s short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when the Utilities borrow money to cover the lag between when they purchase natural gas and when their customers pay for that gas. Changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas (including cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri s use of natural gas derivative instruments), variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the Utilities PGA clauses and GSA riders, the seasonality of accounts receivable balances, and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short-term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year, and may cause significant variations in the Company s cash provided by or used in operating activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 5.7 from 2018 to 2019, primarily driven by fluctuations in working capital items. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 168.3 from fiscal 2017 to 2018 due to working capital fluctuations largely driven by the relative weather conditions and gas prices during the periods. 
 In fiscal 2019, the Company used 306.6 more cash in investing activities than in 2018 and 98.2 more in 2018 than in 2017. Capital expenditures increased 323.9 from fiscal 2018 to 2019, primarily as a result of 110.5 higher expenditures for the Spire STL Pipeline project and a 118.9 increase in infrastructure upgrades, new business development and investment to support customer growth across Missouri and Alabama. A further 89.9 in expenditures related to the development of Spire Storage. Spire estimates its capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 will be approximately 590, including 520 for the Utilities and 70 for Spire Storage and completion expenditures on Spire STL Pipeline. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased 282.7 from 2018 to 2019 after decreasing 58.3 from fiscal 2017 to 2018. The increase in 2019 versus 2018 was primarily due to the issuance of preferred shares for 242.0 and an increase in net debt issuance of 189.2. These increases were only partly offset by the 135.2 reduction in funds received from common stock issuances in 2019 versus 2018. Cash provided by financing activities decreased 58.3 from 2017 to 2018, reflecting changes in the net issuance or repayment of long-term debt, with a 30.0 net repayment in 2018 and a 26.2 net issuance in 2017. Short-term borrowings and dividends paid trended higher over the three years.

CA PITAL RESOURCES 
 The Company s, Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs, may depend on the credit rating of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. Our debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard & Poor s Corporation S&P and Moody s Investors Service Moody s ). As of September 30, 2019, the debt ratings of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, shown in the following table, remain at investment grade with a stable outlook.

It is management s view that the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have adequate access to capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and external, to meet anticipated capital requirements, which primarily include capital expenditures, interest payments on long-term debt, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, short-term seasonal needs and dividends. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Bank deposits were used to support working capital needs of the business. Spire had no temporary cash investments as of September 30, 2019 or 2018. Due to lower yields available to Spire on short-term investments, the Company elected to provide all of Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s short-term funding through intercompany lending during the past fiscal year. 
 Short-term Debt 
 The Utilities short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during the colder months, while most of the Company s other needs are less seasonal. These short-term cash requirements can be met through the sale of commercial paper or through the use of a revolving credit facility. For information about these resources, see Note 7 , Notes Payable and Credit Agreements, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 and Interest Rate Risk under MARKET RISK below. 
 Long-term Debt and Equity 
 At September 30, 2019, including the current portion but excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, Spire had long-term debt totaling 2,137.0, of which 930.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, 415.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and 102.0 was issued by other subsidiaries. For more information about long-term debt, see Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 and Interest Rate Risk under MARKET RISK below. 
 Spire Missouri was authorized by the MoPSC to issue registered securities (first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt and preferred stock), common stock, and private placement debt in an aggregate amount of up to 500.0 for financings placed any time before September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2019, 400.0 remained available under this authorization. Spire Missouri issued an additional 275.0 of bonds on November 12, 2019. Spire Alabama has no standing authority to issue long-term debt and must petition the APSC for each planned issuance. On July 9, 2019, the APSC approved 100.0 of additional long-term financing. 
 Spire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the issuance and sale of up to 250,000 shares of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. There were 158,373 and 154,316 shares at September 30, 2019 and November 21, 2019, respectively, remaining available for issuance under this Form S-3. Spire and Spire Missouri also have a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of various equity and debt securities, which expires on May 14, 2022. 
 48 

On February 6, 2019, Spire entered into an at-the-market equity distribution agreement, supplemented as of May 14, 2019, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 150.0. Those shares are issued pursuant to Spire s universal shelf registration statement referenced above and a prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2019. In the year ended September 30, 2019 , Spire issued 179 ,630 shares under this program, generating 1 4. 4 of proceeds net of issuance costs. 
 On May 21, 2019, Spire issued 5.90 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, resulting in 242.0 of proceeds net of issuance costs. 
 Including the current portion of long-term debt, the Company s long-term consolidated capitalization at September 30, 2019 consisted of 55 equity, compared to 52 equity at September 30, 2018. For more information about equity, see Note 5 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.

 Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instrument s stated maturity. See Note 6 , Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 

(b) 
 
 Lease obligations are primarily for office space and power operated equipment. Additional payments will be incurred if renewal options are exercised under the provisions of certain agreements. 

(c) 
 
 These purchase obligations represent the minimum payments required under existing natural gas transportation and storage contracts and natural gas supply agreements in the Gas Utility and Gas Marketing segments. These amounts reflect fixed obligations as well as obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using September 30, 2019 forward market prices. Each of the Utilities generally recovers costs related to its purchases, transportation and storage of natural gas through the operation of its PGA clause or GSA rider, subject to prudence review by the appropriate regional public service commission. Variations in the timing of collections of gas costs from customers may affect short-term cash requirements. Additional contractual commitments are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season. 

(d) 
 
 These purchase obligations primarily reflect miscellaneous agreements for the purchase of materials and the procurement of services necessary for normal operations. 

(e) 
 
 Long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits, totaling 10.7, have been excluded from the table above because the timing of future cash outflows, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. Also, commitments related to pension and postretirement benefit plans have been excluded from the table above. The Company expects to contribute 42.8 to its qualified, trusteed pension plans and 0.6 to its non-qualified pension plans during fiscal 2020. With regard to the postretirement benefits, the Company anticipates it will contribute 2.0 to the qualified trusts and 0.5 directly to participants from Spire Missouri funds during fiscal 2020. For further discussion of the Company s pension and postretirement benefit plans, refer to Note 13 , Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 The Utilities and other Spire subsidiaries own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company s, Spire Missouri s or Spire Alabama s financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations and their interpretations change, however, the Company and the Utilities may be required to incur additional costs. For information relative to environmental matters, see Contingencies in Note 16 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 At September 30, 2019, the Company had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases, surety bonds, and letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not expect to engage in any significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future. 
 MARKET RISK 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Gas Utility 
 The Utilities commodity price risk, which arises from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, is primarily managed through the operation of the Missouri Utilities PGA clauses and Spire Alabama s GSA rider. The PGA clauses and GSA rider allows the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC and APSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. Spire Missouri is allowed the flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. Spire Missouri is able to mitigate, to some extent, changes in commodity prices through the use of physical storage supplies and regional supply diversity. The Utilities also have risk management policies that allow for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing its price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. These policies prohibit speculation. As of September 30, 2019, Spire Missouri had active natural gas derivative positions, but Spire Alabama did not. Costs and cost reduction, including carrying costs, associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to customers through the operation of the PGA clauses or GSA rider. Accordingly, the Utilities do not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. However, the timing of recovery for cash payments related to margin requirements may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. For more information about the Utilities natural gas derivative instruments, see Note 10 , Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 Gas Marketing 
 In the course of its business, Spire s non-regulated gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing, enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and natural gas index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. In accordance with the risk management policy, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed price commitments. This risk is currently managed either by closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed-prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to lock in margins. At September 30, 2019 and 2018, Spire Marketing s unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire s financial position or results of operations. 
 50 

As mentioned above, Spire Marketing uses natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the NYMEX and ICE to manage the commodity price risk associated with its fixed-price natural gas purchase and sale commitments. These derivative instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales. Such accounting treatment, if elected, generally permits a substantial portion of the gain or loss to be deferred from recognition in earnings until the period that the associated forecasted purchase or sale is recognized in earnings. To the extent a hedge is effective, gains or losses on the derivatives will be offset by changes in the value of the hedged forecasted transactions.

Certain of Spire Marketing s physical natural gas derivative contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales, as permitted by GAAP. This election permits the Company to account for the contract in the period the natural gas is delivered. Contracts not designated as normal purchases or normal sales, including those designated as trading activities, are accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to settlement.

Counterparty Credit Risk 
 Spire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with energy producers, utility companies and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. To the extent possible, Spire Marketing enters into netting arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate exposure to credit risk. It is also exposed to credit risk associated with its derivative contracts designated as normal purchases and normal sales. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. For more information on these and other concentrations of credit risk, including how Spire Marketing manages these risks, see Note 11 , Concentrations of Credit Risk, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company is subject to interest rate risk associated with its short-term debt issuances. Based on average short-term borrowings during fiscal 2019, an increase of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for short-term debt would have caused an increase in interest expense (and a decrease in pre-tax earnings and cash flows) of approximately 5.7 on an annual basis. Portions of such an increase may be offset through the Utilities application of PGA and GSA carrying costs. At September 30, 2019, Spire had 100.0 of variable rate long-term debt outstanding and had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling 2,037.0. Spire Missouri had 100.0 of variable rate long-term debt outstanding and had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling 830.0 and Spire Alabama had fixed-rate long-term debt of 415.0, all included in Spire s total long-term debt. While the long-term debt issues are fixed-rate, they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemptions of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period. 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Spire entered into an interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 2.658 and a notional amount of 60.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. In September 2019, this hedge was settled, resulting in a loss of 6.1 which will be amortized over the hedged periods. In August 2018, Spire entered into a three-year interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 2.7675 and a notional amount of 100.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future variable interest rate payments. The Company recorded a 2.9 mark-to-market loss on this swap as part of other comprehensive income for the year ended September 30, 2019. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company entered into a thirty-year interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 3.250 expiring in three years and a notional amount of 100.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in future interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a 34.4 mark-to-market loss on this swap as part of other comprehensive income for the year ended September 30, 2019. 
 Refer to Note 10 , Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional details on these interest rate swap transactions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Spire Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Spire Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019, of the Company and our report dated November 26, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Spire Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Spire Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 26, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Regulatory Matters Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 15 and Note 18 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company accounts for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations . The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). 
 56 

The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Missouri, Alabama, and Mississippi Public Service Commissions (the Commissions ), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of natural gas companies within their respective geographies. The Company has stated that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. 
 Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items, including property, plant, and equipment regulatory assets and liabilities operating revenues and depreciation expense, and affects multiple disclosures in the Company s financial statements. There is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. As a result, we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of current and future regulatory orders on events that have occurred as of September 30, 2019, and the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures. Management judgments included assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs or (2) refunds to customers or future reduction in rates. These judgments included assessing the likelihood and amount of potential refunds that may be required by the Missouri Public Service Commission related to previously recovered capital investments as a result of the November 2019 Missouri Western District Court rulings. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these rate-impacted account balances and disclosures, and the related judgments, requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to the inherent complexities associated with the specialized rules related to accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 

We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over evaluating the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 

We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements. 

We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company in Missouri, Alabama, and Mississippi regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, and filings made by interveners and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 

We obtained from management the regulatory orders that support the probability of recovery, refund, and/or future reduction in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities and assessed management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates. 

We evaluated management s assessment of the probability that the Missouri Public Service Commission will order refunds of certain revenues previously collected from customers as a result of the November 2019 rulings issued by the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals. We evaluated the amount of the regulatory liability management recorded as a result of these rulings, evaluated management s assessment of potential future refunds, and evaluated management s disclosures regarding these rulings.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share, per unit and per gallon amounts) 
 
 NATURE OF OPERATIONS Spire (NYSE: SR) has reportable segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. The Gas Utility segment consists of the regulated natural gas distribution operations of the Company and is the core business segment of Spire in terms of revenue and earnings generation. The Gas Utility segment is comprised of the operations of: the Missouri Utilities, serving St. Louis and eastern Missouri Spire Missouri East and Kansas City and western Missouri Spire Missouri West Spire Alabama, serving central and northern Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth, serving southern Alabama and south-central Mississippi. The Gas Marketing Segment includes Spire s primary non-utility business, Spire Marketing Inc. Spire Marketing ), which provides non-regulated natural gas services, primarily in the central and southern United States (U.S.). The activities of other subsidiaries are reported as Other and are described in Note 14 , Information by Operating Segment. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama each have a single reportable segment.

 of the original cost of depreciable and amortizable property. 
 For Spire Alabama, depreciation is provided using the composite method of depreciation on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of utility property at rates approved by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC). The composite depreciation rate in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 was approximately . 
 Non-utility Property Non-utility property is recorded at the original cost of acquisition or construction, which includes material, labor, contractor services and, for FERC-regulated projects, an allowance for funds used during construction. Repairs, replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not increase the property s life or functionality are charged to maintenance expense. Upon retirement or sale of non-utility property, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the income statements. Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related software. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss in the income statements.

and , respectively. The carrying value of the Utilities inventory is never adjusted to a lower net realizable value or market value because, pursuant to Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses or a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider, actual gas costs are recovered in customer rates. Natural gas and propane gas storage inventory in Spire s other operating segments is recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. voting interest in a natural gas storage facility in Wyoming. The transaction was valued at , consisting of in cash and a non-interest-bearing note valued at . In October 2018, the Company completed the exercise of its right to call the remaining voting interest in that facility and settled the related note for a combined total of .

Outstanding checks on the Company s and Utilities bank accounts in excess of funds on deposit create book overdrafts (which are funded at the time checks are presented for payment) and are classified as Other in the Current Liabilities section of the balance sheets. Changes in book overdrafts are reflected as Operating Activities in the statements of cash flows. In Spire s statements of cash flows, total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash included of restricted cash reported in Other current assets on Spire s balance sheet as of September 30, 2018 (in addition to amounts shown as Cash and cash equivalents ).

Spire Alabama relies upon ongoing payments as the primary indicator of credit quality during the term of each contract. The allowance for credit losses is recognized using an estimate of write-off percentages based on historical experience. Delinquent accounts are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and, absent evidence of debt repayment, after days are due in full and assigned to a third-party collection agency. The remaining finance receivable is written off approximately months after being assigned to the third-party collection agency. Spire Alabama had finance receivables past due 90 days or more of at September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018.

 , and ), respectively, from operation and maintenance to other income (expense), net. The corresponding amounts for the year ended September 30, 2017 were , and , respectively. For Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, and the Company s other rate-regulated entities, all components of net benefit cost have historically been recovered from customers as a component of utility plant and will continue to be recovered in the same manner over the depreciable lives of the related plant assets therefore, for those entities, the components that are no longer eligible to be capitalized as a component of plant under GAAP will be reported as regulatory assets . 
 Effective January 1, 2019, the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama adopted ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software: Customer s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract . Previous GAAP did not specifically address the accounting for implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The amendments in this update clarify that accounting and align the accounting for implementation costs for hosting arrangements, regardless of whether they convey a license to the hosted software. As a result, certain categories of implementation costs that previously would have been charged to expense as incurred are now capitalized as prepayments and amortized over the term of the arrangement. The new guidance is being applied prospectively to implementation costs incurred after adoption. Related amounts capitalized were not material. 
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash . This guidance requires the statement of cash flows to present changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, the relevant accounting guidance did not require the statement of cash flows to include changes in restricted cash. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama adopted the standard retrospectively in 2018 with no impact to 2017.

 of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases (including approximately and for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively) but will not result in a cumulative effect adjustment or significant impacts to income or cash flows. 
 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities . The amendments in this ASU more closely align the results of hedge accounting with risk management activities through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results in the financial statements. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama do not expect the adoption of this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to have a significant impact on the financial statements. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , which was later supplemented by ASU Nos. 2018-19, 2019-04 and 2019-05. The standard introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope, including trade receivables. The new guidance will be initially applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are currently assessing the impacts of adopting this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

 During fiscal 2019, the Company granted performance-contingent restricted share units to executive officers and key employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. This number represents the target shares that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards. The share units have a performance period ending . While the participants have no interim voting rights on these share units, dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid to the participants upon vesting but are subject to forfeiture if the underlying share units do not vest. 
 The number of share units that will ultimately vest is dependent upon the attainment of certain levels of earnings and other strategic goals, as well as the Company s level of total shareholder return (TSR) during the performance period relative to a comparator group of companies. This TSR provision is considered a market condition under GAAP and is discussed further below. The maximum amount of shares that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards is of the target units granted. 
 The weighted average grant date fair value of performance-contingent restricted share units granted during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was and per share, respectively.

The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period. A percent dividend yield was used, which is mathematically equivalent to the assumption that dividends are reinvested as they are paid. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock. Volatility assumptions were also made for each of the companies included in the comparator group. The vesting period is equal to the performance period set forth in the terms of the award.

These mortgage restrictions are applicable regardless of whether the stock is publicly held or held solely by Spire Missouri s parent company. Under the most restrictive of these provisions, no cash dividend may be declared or paid if, after the dividend, the aggregate net amount spent for all dividends after September 30, 1953 would exceed a maximum amount determined by a formula set out in the mortgage. Under that formula, the maximum amount is the sum of plus earnings applicable to common stock (adjusted for stock repurchases and issuances) for the period from September 30, 1953 to the last day of the quarter before the declaration or payment date for the dividends. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the amount under the mortgage s formula that was available to pay dividends was and , respectively.

 Spire Missouri 
 Spire Missouri has a risk management policy to utilize various derivatives, including futures contracts, exchange-traded options, swaps and over-the-counter instruments for the explicit purpose of managing price risk associated with purchasing and delivering natural gas on a regular basis to customers in accordance with its tariffs. The objective of this policy is to limit Spire Missouri s exposure to natural gas price volatility and to manage, hedge and mitigate substantial price risk. This policy strictly prohibits speculation and permits Spire Missouri to hedge current physical natural gas purchase commitments or forecasted or anticipated future peak (maximum) physical need for natural gas delivered. Costs and cost reductions, including carrying costs, associated with Spire Missouri s use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to Spire Missouri customers through the operation of its PGA clause, through which the MoPSC allows Spire Missouri to recover gas supply costs, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC. Accordingly, Spire Missouri does not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. 
 Spire Missouri does not designate these instruments as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes because gains or losses associated with the use of these derivative instruments are deferred and recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations , and, as a result, have no direct impact on the statements of income. 
 The timing of the operation of the PGA clause may cause interim variations in short-term cash flows, because Spire Missouri is subject to cash margin requirements associated with changes in the values of these instruments. Nevertheless, carrying costs associated with such requirements are recovered through the PGA clause. 
 From time to time, Spire Missouri purchases NYMEX futures and options contracts to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment used in the course of its business. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The gains or losses on these derivative instruments are not subject to Spire Missouri s PGA clause. At September 30, 2019, Spire Missouri had no gasoline futures contracts outstanding.

 During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, Spire Alabama commenced a gasoline derivative program to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment used in the course of its business. Most of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The gains or losses on these derivative instruments are not subject to Spire Alabama s GSA rider. There were no contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2019 and 2018. million customers in states across multiple rate classes resulting in a significant amount of revenue diversity. Credit risk is mitigated by the high percentage of residential customers as well as the geographic diversity of the Utilities, though customers for each Utility are concentrated in a single state. 
 A significant portion of Spire Marketing s transactions are with (or are associated with) energy producers, utility companies, and pipelines. The concentration of transactions with these counterparties has the potential to affect the Company s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. To manage this risk, as well as credit risk from significant counterparties in these and other industries, Spire Marketing has established procedures to determine the creditworthiness of its counterparties. These procedures include obtaining credit ratings and credit reports, analyzing counterparty financial statements to assess financial condition, and considering the industry environment in which the counterparty operates. This information is monitored on an ongoing basis. In some instances, Spire Marketing may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit, or parental guaranties. In addition, Spire Marketing may enter into netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties in the energy industry with whom it conducts both sales and purchases of natural gas. Sales are typically made on an unsecured credit basis with payment due the month following delivery. Accounts receivable amounts are closely monitored and provisions for uncollectible amounts are accrued when losses are probable. Spire Marketing records accounts receivable, accounts payable, and prepayments for physical sales and purchases of natural gas on a gross basis. The amount included in its accounts receivable attributable to energy producers and their marketing affiliates totaled at September 30, 2019 reflecting netting arrangements). Spire Marketing s accounts receivable attributable to utility companies and their marketing affiliates totaled at September 30, 2019 reflecting netting arrangements). 
 Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with pipeline companies associated with its natural gas receivable and with certain individually significant counterparties. At September 30, 2019, the amounts included in accounts receivable from its largest counterparties (in terms of net accounts receivable exposure) totaled reflecting netting arrangements). of these five counterparties are investment-grade rated integrated utilities. The fifth is not rated, but each of its owners is investment-grade.

 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law on December 22, 2017, with an effective date of January 1, 2018, for substantially all of the provisions. This comprehensive act includes significant reform of the current income tax code including changes in the calculation for business entities and a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from to . The specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the TCJA generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, the elimination of full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired after September 27, 2017 and the continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. The Department of the Treasury Treasury has issued proposed regulations associated with the deductibility of interest expense, but further clarification of certain provisions is expected. Treasury has also issued proposed regulations on bonus depreciation which allow full expensing for certain property acquired in tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2018. 
 ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires that the effects of changes in tax laws be recognized in the period in which the new law is enacted. It also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. For the Company s regulated entities, the changes in deferred taxes related to the regulated operations are recorded as either an offset to or creation of a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject to refund to customers in future periods. The changes in deferred taxes that are not associated with rate making (including all changes for the Company s non-regulated operations) are recorded as adjustments to deferred tax expense or benefit.

In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years, the timing of deferred tax liability reversals, projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback years, and tax planning strategies to assess the need for a valuation allowance. Based upon this evidence, management believes it is more likely than not the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets, except for the contribution carryforward valuation allowances noted below. 
 The Company had federal and state loss carryforwards of approximately at September 30, 2019. The loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal for certain state purposes and fiscal for federal and other states purposes.

 Spire plans met the criteria for settlement recognition for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 Spire Alabama plans and Spire Missouri plan met the criteria for settlement recognition, requiring re-measurement of the obligation under those plans using updated census data and assumptions for discount rate and mortality. For the remeasurements, the discount rates for the Missouri plans were updated to and at June 30, 2018 (from and at September 30, 2017), and the discount rate for the Alabama plan was updated to (from ). Lump-sum payments recognized as settlements during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were attributable to Spire Missouri and to Spire Alabama) and attributable to Spire Missouri and to Spire Alabama), respectively. 
 Pursuant to a MoPSC Order, the return on plan assets is based on the market-related value of plan assets implemented prospectively over a four-year period. Gains or losses not yet includible in pension cost are amortized only to the extent that such gain or loss exceeds of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. Such excess is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. 
 Up to April 18, 2018, the recovery in rates for Spire Missouri East s qualified pension plan was based on an annual allowance of effective January 1, 2011.

Effective April 19, 2018, the pension cost for Spire Missouri West included in customer rates was reduced from to per year, the pension cost included in the Spire Missouri East customer rates was increased from to per year. Over an amortization period of , Spire Missouri East rates also include the amortization of of assets for pension and other postretirement benefits, and Spire Missouri West rates will be reduced by the amortization of a net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits. These changes are discussed further in Note 15 , Regulatory Matters.

Total Regulatory Assets Not Earning a Return 

Like all the Company s regulatory assets, these regulatory assets are expected to be recovered from customers in future rates. The recovery period for the future income taxes due from customers and pension and other postretirement benefit costs could be as long as years or longer, based on current Internal Revenue Service guidelines and average remaining service life of active participants, respectively. The other items not earning a return are expected to be recovered over a period not to exceed years, consistent with precedent set by the MoPSC. Spire Alabama does not have any regulatory assets that are not earning a return. 
 Spire Missouri 
 As authorized by the MoPSC, the PGA clause allows Spire Missouri to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. To better match customer billings with market natural gas prices, Spire Missouri is allowed to file to modify, on a periodic basis, the level of gas costs in its PGA. Certain provisions of the PGA clause are included below: 

Spire Missouri has a risk management policy that allows for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. The MoPSC clarified that costs, cost reductions, and carrying costs associated with the Utility s use of natural gas derivative instruments are gas costs recoverable through the PGA mechanism. 

The tariffs allow Spire Missouri flexibility to make up to discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least . 

Spire Missouri is authorized to apply carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, including cash payments for margin deposits. 

The MoPSC approved a plan applicable to Spire Missouri s gas supply commodity costs under which it retains a portion of cost savings associated with the acquisition of natural gas below an established benchmark level. This gas supply cost management program allows Spire Missouri to retain of cost savings, up to a maximum of annually. Spire Missouri did not record any such incentive compensation under the plan during the three fiscal years reported. Incentives recorded under the plan, if any, are included in Gas Utility Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income and under Operating Revenues on Spire Missouri s Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

 Pursuant to the provisions of the PGA clause, the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clause are reflected as a deferred charge or credit at the end of the fiscal year. At that time, the balance is classified as a current asset or current liability and recovered from, or credited to, customers over an annual period commencing in November. The balance in the current account is amortized as amounts are reflected in customer billings.

 to . In the latest rate cases (discussed in the following paragraphs), the multiple sharing tiers and percentages were eliminated in favor of a single sharing percentage under which customers receive (and Spire Missouri receives of the net margins achieved as a result of such off-system sales and capacity releases. 
 On March 7, 2018, the MoPSC issued its order in two general rate cases (docketed as GR-2017-0215 and GR-2017-0216), approving new tariffs that became effective on April 19, 2018. Certain provisions of the order allow less future recovery of certain deferred or capitalized costs than estimated based upon previous rate proceedings, and management determined that the related regulatory assets should be written down or off in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the second quarter of 2018. The charges totaled for the year ended September 30, 2018 and are included primarily in operation and maintenance expense on the statements of income and in other cash flows from operating activities on the statements of cash flows. The after-tax reduction to net income and earnings per share was and , respectively. On April 25, 2018, Spire Missouri filed an appeal of the MoPSC s order related to the disallowance of certain pension costs incurred prior to 1997 ), real estate sold in 2014 ), and rate case expenses to Missouri s Southern District Court of Appeals. On March 15, 2019, the appeal was denied by the Southern District, and Spire Missouri requested review by the Missouri Supreme Court, which recently decided to take the case. The charges related to the long-standing pension and real estate assets, totaling , were excluded in the determination of 2018 net economic earnings, as shown in Note 14 , Information by Operating Segment. 
 On July 15, 2019, Spire Missouri filed Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS) applications which were ultimately approved by the MoPSC for a total of of additional annual ISRS revenue related to investments made to replace worn out or deteriorated infrastructure. ISRS rates reflecting these additional revenues became effective November 16, 2019, bringing total authorized future annualized ISRS revenues for Spire Missouri to . For more information about ISRS proceedings, see Note 18 , Subsequent Event. 
 Spire Alabama 
 Spire Alabama s rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama s tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA rider, which is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama s earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather-related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment.

 to with an adjusting point of . Spire Alabama was eligible to receive a performance-based adjustment of basis points to the ROE adjusting point, based on meeting certain customer satisfaction criteria. Under its Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) rate-setting process, the APSC conducts quarterly reviews to determine whether Spire Alabama s ROE at the end of the rate year will be within the allowed range of return. Reductions in rates can be made quarterly to bring the projected ROE within the allowed range increases, however, are allowed only once each rate year, effective December 1, and cannot exceed of prior-year revenues. In October 2018, the APSC approved the renewal of RSE through September 30, 2022, with several modifications. Effective October 1, 2018, Spire Alabama s allowed range of ROE is to with an adjusting point of . Spire Alabama is eligible to receive a performance-based adjustment of +/- 10 basis point to the ROE adjusting point, based upon the terms of the newly approved Accelerated Infrastructure Modernization (AIM) Program tariff. The 5-basis point adjustment for certain customer satisfaction criteria has been removed. Other modifications include an equity limitation as a percent of total capitalization from to and adjustments to the Cost Control Measure (CCM) as noted below. 
 The RSE reduction for the September 30, 2017 quarterly point of test was to bring the expected ROE at the end of the year to within the allowed range of return, effective December 1, 2017. As part of the annual update for RSE, on November 30, 2017, Spire Alabama filed an increase for rate year 2018 of , which also became effective December 1, 2017. There was no RSE reduction in 2018 for the January 31, April 30, July 31 or September 30 quarterly points of test. Effective February 1, 2018, Spire Alabama rates were reduced by to reflect the impact of tax reform under the TCJA on current income taxes. On November 30, 2018, Spire Alabama filed an increase for rate year 2019 of , which became effective December 1, 2018. There was no RSE reduction in 2019 for the January 31, April 30, July 31 or September 30 quarterly points of test. On October 24, 2019, Spire Alabama made its annual RSE rate filing with the APSC, presenting the utility s budget for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, including net income and a calculation of allowed ROE. The AIM mechanism provides for a basis-point increase in the allowed ROE each year if a prescribed number of pipeline miles are replaced. Spire Alabama exceeded the threshold for 2019 and accordingly filed for a ROE for fiscal 2020. 
 In November 2019, the APSC approved Spire Alabama s proposal to establish a mechanism under its GSA rider allowing the utility to create value through off-system sales of excess natural gas supply and capacity and to retain of the value created while giving of the value to customers. Spire Alabama expects the mechanism to be effective with the establishment of new rates on December 1, 2019. 
 The inflation-based CCM, established by the APSC, allows for annual increases to operation and maintenance O&M expense. If rate year O&M expense falls within the index range, no adjustment is required. If rate year O&M expense exceeds the index range, three-quarters of the difference is returned to customers through future rate adjustments. To the extent rate year O&M is less than the index range, Spire Alabama benefits by one-half of the difference through future rate adjustments. Certain items that fluctuate based on situations demonstrated to be beyond Spire Alabama s control may be excluded from the CCM calculation. Before fiscal 2019, the CCM index range was Spire Alabama s 2007 actual rate year O&M expense inflation-adjusted based on the June Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) each rate year, plus or minus . Effective October 1, 2018, the CCM is calculated based upon O&M expense per customer and the index range is Spire Alabama s actual 2018 O&M expense adjusted for inflation and adjusted by 2/3 and 1/3 of the 2018 CCM differential (amount below the CCM range in 2018) in 2019 and 2020, respectively, plus or minus . As of September 30, 2019, Spire Alabama recorded a CCM benefit of for rate year 2019, which will be reflected in rates effective December 1, 2019. The CCM benefit was for rate year 2018 and for rate year 2017.

 , , and , respectively. 
 The APSC approved an ESR in 1998, which was subsequently modified and expanded in 2010. As currently approved, the ESR provides deferred treatment and recovery for the following: (1) extraordinary O&M expenses related to environmental response costs (2) extraordinary O&M expenses related to self-insurance costs that exceed per occurrence (3) extraordinary O&M expenses, other than environmental response costs and self-insurance costs, resulting from a single force majeure event or multiple force majeure events greater than and , respectively, during a rate year and (4) negative individual large commercial and industrial customer budget revenue variances that exceed during a rate year. Charges to the ESR are subject to certain limitations which may disallow deferred treatment and which prescribe the timing of recovery. Funding to the ESR is provided as a reduction to the refundable negative salvage balance over its nine-year term beginning December 1, 2010. Subsequent to the nine-year period and subject to APSC authorization, Spire Alabama expects to be able to recover underfunded ESR balances over a five-year amortization period with an annual limitation of . Amounts in excess of this limitation are deferred for recovery in future years. 
 Spire Alabama has APSC approval for an intercompany revolving credit agreement allowing Spire Alabama to borrow from Spire in a principal amount not to exceed at any time outstanding in combination with its bank line of credit, and to loan to Spire in a principal amount not to exceed at any time outstanding. Borrowings may be used for the following purposes: (a) meeting increased working capital requirements (b) financing construction requirements related to additions, extensions, and replacements of the distribution systems and (c) financing other expenditures that may arise from time to time in the normal course of business. On October 2, 2018, the APSC approved an application for up to of long-term debt financing (issued January 15, 2019), and on July 9, 2019, the APSC approved Spire Alabama s application for of additional long-term financing. 
 Spire 
 In addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is affected by the following regulatory matters. 
 Spire Gulf has similar rate regulation to Spire Alabama. The RSE allowed range of ROE is to with an adjusting point of . The CCM has the same return and similar recovery provisions when expenses exceed or are under a band of +/- around the CPI-U inflated O&M per customer expense level from 2017, excluding expenses for pensions and gas bad debt. Additionally, it has a Cast Iron Main Replacement factor that provides an enhanced return on the pro-rata costs associated with cast iron main replacement for miles over 10 miles per year based on a weighting for the equity content. Spire Gulf also has an ESR for negative revenue variances over or a force majeure event expense of (or two events that exceed ), a Self Insurance Reserve for general liability coverage, and an Environmental Cost Recovery Factor that recovers of prudently incurred costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations. It also has an APSC-approved intercompany revolving credit agreement with Spire to borrow in a principal amount not to exceed , and to loan up to . Spire Gulf recorded a September 30, 2019 point of test refund under the RSE rate mechanism for approximately and also recorded a CCM benefit for rate year 2019 of . On October 25, 2019, Spire Gulf made its annual RSE rate filing with the APSC based on its budget for fiscal 2020 and an allowed ROE of 10.7 . 
 Spire Gulf s rates were reduced effective February 1, 2018, to reflect lower income taxes resulting from the TCJA.

), and is updated on an annual basis if the equity return on an end of period rate base is beyond the allowed return on equity by , with of any shortfall back to the midpoint being put into a rate increase and of any excess back to the midpoint resulting in a rate decrease. Updates may include known and measurable adjustments to historic costs from the 12 months ended June 30, submitted September 15 for an effective date of November 1, unless disputed by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, with any disputes to be resolved by the MSPSC by January 15 of the following year. In December 2015, a Supplemental Growth Rider (SGR) was approved for a -year period to provide recovery of certain system expansion projects. On September 4, 2018, the SGR was extended to October 15, 2021. 
 On February 5, 2019, the MSPSC approved an agreement between Spire Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utility Staff settling its Rates Stabilization and Adjustments filing that was made on September 14, 2018 resulting in a increase in the annualized revenue requirement. New rates became effective March 1, 2019. 
 In August 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved an order issuing a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Spire STL Pipeline, and in November 2018, FERC issued a Notice to Proceed, allowing construction to begin. In October 2019, FERC approved an increase in Spire STL Pipeline s initial recourse rate. Accordingly, under the terms of the January 2017 Precedent Agreement between Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Missouri, Spire Missouri s negotiated rate automatically increased by two cents per dekatherm per day. In November 2019, Spire STL Pipeline received final authorization from FERC and placed the STL Pipeline into service. 
 On January 25, 2019, FERC approved the Company s application to combine its two adjacent natural gas storage facilities in Wyoming under one FERC certificate with a market-based tariff. In August 2019, Spire Storage filed with the FERC two Prior Notice Applications of its intent to convert a total of six existing observation wells into injection/withdrawal wells and to install related gas flowlines, fuel gas lines and fiber optic communication. The applications cleared FERC authorization in October and November. , and for the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Additional contracts are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season of November through April. The Utilities recover their costs from customers in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders. 
 Spire NGL Inc. is providing liquid propane transportation service to Spire Missouri pursuant to an approved FERC tariff and a contractual arrangement with Spire Missouri. In accordance with the terms of that agreement, Spire Missouri is obligated to pay Spire NGL Inc. approximately annually, at current rates. The agreement renews at the end of each contract year, unless terminated by either party upon provision of at least notice. 
 A consolidated subsidiary is a general partner in an unconsolidated partnership that invests in real estate partnerships. The subsidiary and third parties are jointly and severally liable for the payment of mortgage loans in the aggregate outstanding amount of approximately incurred in connection with various real estate ventures. Spire has no reason to believe that the other principal liable parties will not be able to meet their proportionate share of these obligations. Spire further believes that the asset values of the real estate properties are sufficient to support these mortgage loans.

Spire Alabama 

Amounts in the table above have not been reduced for sublease rentals. For Spire Alabama and Spire, annual sublease rentals were for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, and minimum future rentals to be received in fiscal year 2020 are . 
 Contingencies 
 The Company and the Utilities account for contingencies, including environmental liabilities, in accordance with accounting standards under the loss contingency guidance of ASC Topic 450, Contingencies , when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 
 In addition to matters noted below, the Company and the Utilities are involved in other litigation, claims, and investigations arising in the normal course of business. Management, after discussion with counsel, believes the final outcome will not have a material effect on the statements of income, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows of the Company, Spire Missouri, or Spire Alabama. However, there is uncertainty in the valuation of pending claims and prediction of litigation results. 
 The Company and the Utilities own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company s or Utilities financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and their interpretations change, the Company or the Utilities may incur additional environmental liabilities that may result in additional costs, which may be material. 
 In the natural gas industry, many gas distribution companies have incurred environmental liabilities associated with sites they or their predecessor companies formerly owned or operated where manufactured gas operations took place. The Utilities each have former manufactured gas plant (MGP) operations in their respective service territories. To the extent costs are incurred associated with environmental remediation activities, the Utilities would request authority from their respective regulators to defer such costs (less any amounts received from insurance proceeds or as contributions from other potentially responsible parties (PRPs)) and collect them through future rates. 
 Spire Missouri 
 Spire Missouri has identified former MGP sites in the city of St. Louis, Missouri (the City where costs have been incurred and claims have been asserted. Spire Missouri has enrolled of the sites in the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) Brownfields/Voluntary Cleanup Program (BVCP). The third site is the result of a relatively new claim assertion by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and such claim is currently being investigated.

 owned MGP sites enrolled in the BVCP, including Joplin MGP #1, St. Joseph MGP #1, Kansas City Coal Gas Station B, Kansas City Station A Railroad area, Kansas City Coal Gas Station A North, Kansas City Coal Gas Station A South, and Independence MGP #2. Source removal has been conducted at all of the owned sites since 2003 with the exception of Joplin. On September 15, 2016, a request was made with the MDNR for a restrictive covenant use limitation with respect to Joplin. Remediation efforts at the seven sites are at various stages of completion, ranging from groundwater monitoring and sampling following source removal activities to the aforementioned request in respect to Joplin. As part of its participation in the BVCP, Spire Missouri communicates regularly with the MDNR with respect to its remediation efforts and monitoring activities at these sites. On May 11, 2015, MDNR approved the next phase of investigation at the Kansas City Station A North and Railroad areas. 
 130 
 
 former MGP sites owned or operated by Spire Missouri. The purpose of this analysis was to develop an estimated range of probabilistic future liability for each site. That analysis, completed in August 2014, provided a range of demonstrated possible future expenditures to investigate, monitor and remediate all 19 MGP sites. Spire Missouri has recorded its best estimate of the probable expenditures that relate to these matters. The amount is not material. 
 Spire Missouri and the Company do not expect potential liabilities that may arise from remediating these sites to have a material impact on their future financial condition or results of operations. 
 Spire Alabama 
 Spire Alabama is in the chain of title of former MGP sites, of which it still owns, and former manufactured gas distribution sites, of which it still owns. Spire Alabama does not foresee a probable or reasonably estimable loss associated with these sites. Spire Alabama and the Company do not expect potential liabilities that may arise from remediating these sites to have a material impact on their future financial condition or results of operations. 
 In 2012, Spire Alabama responded to an EPA Request for Information Pursuant to Section 104 of CERCLA relating to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site located in North Birmingham, Jefferson County, Alabama. Spire Alabama was identified as a PRP under CERCLA for the cleanup of the site or costs the EPA incurs in cleaning up the site. At this point, Spire Alabama has not been provided information that would allow it to determine the extent, if any, of its potential liability with respect to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site and vigorously denies its inclusion as a PRP. 
 Spire 
 In addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is aware of the following contingent matter. 
 In February 2018, the Company was made aware of a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by the South Alabama Center for Fair Housing and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. The complaint alleges that the Company discriminated against unspecified residents of Eight Mile, Alabama, on the basis of race in violation of the Fair Housing Act by failing to adequately address the odorant release that occurred in 2008. The Company believes there is no basis for the complaint, HUD has no jurisdiction in the matter, and there will be no material impact on its future financial condition or results of operations.

regulatory liability for this matter by reducing revenue for fiscal year 2019. There are two components of this provision. The first relates to a refund ordered by the ISRS rulings for amounts collected prior to the last rate case, after which recoveries of related authorized revenues became part of base rates that went into effect in April 2018. The second component relates to an estimate of for revenues associated with the June 2018 ISRS filing that was approved by the MoPSC in September 2018. The after-tax impact of the provision reduced net income by , or per diluted share. 
 Additional ISRS revenues are currently under appeal related to the January 2019 ISRS filings with annual authorized revenue of . The estimated amount earned in fiscal year 2019 under this ISRS order was . Additionally, in future periods Spire Missouri will evaluate the need for an adjustment to the provision based upon new information and further developments.

 SECTION 3.2 Additional Circumstances in Which Redeemable. Series A Bonds shall also be redeemable, at the option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount to be redeemed plus the Make-Whole Amount (as defined below) determined for the redemption date with respect to such principal amount, plus accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for redemption without premium. Any redemption in part under this Section 3.2 shall be made pro rata to the holders of all Series A Bonds at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions. 
 For purposes of this Section 3.2: 
 Make-Whole Amount means, with respect to any Series A Bond, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such bond over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that on and after the Series A Par Call Date, the Make-Whole Amount on such Series A Bond shall equal zero; provided further that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 Business Day shall have the meaning set forth in the form of Series A Bond. 
 Called Principal means, with respect to any bond, the principal of such bond that is to be redeemed or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to the Mortgage, as the context requires. 
 Discounted Value means, with respect to the Called Principal of any bond, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such 
 32 

Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the bonds is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal. 
 Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of any bond, .50 over the yield to maturity implied by (i) the yields reported as of 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as Page PX1 (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on the run U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date, or (ii) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), the Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for U.S. Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. 
 In the case of each determination under clause (i) or clause (ii), as the case may be, of the preceding paragraph, such implied yield will be determined, if necessary, by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (b) interpolating linearly between (1) the applicable U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the applicable U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable bond. 
 Remaining Average Life means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment. 
 Remaining Scheduled Payments means, with respect to the Called Principal of any bond, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the Bonds, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to this section. 
 33 

Series A Par Call Date means , with respect to the Series A Bonds, June 15, 2032. 
 Settlement Date means, with respect to the Called Principal of any bond, the date on which such Called Principal is to be redeemed pursuant to this section. 
 SECTION 3.3 Purchase of Bonds. The Company will not and will not permit any affiliate to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the outstanding Series A Bonds except (a) upon the redemption of such bonds in accordance with the terms of Section 3.2 hereof and such bonds or (b) pursuant to an offer to purchase made by the Company or an affiliate pro rata to the holders of all Series A Bonds at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions. Any such offer shall provide each holder with sufficient information to enable it to make an informed decision with respect to such offer, and shall remain open for at least 10 Business Days. If the holders of more than 25 of the principal amount of the Series A Bonds then outstanding accept such offer, the Company shall promptly notify the remaining holders of such fact and the expiration date for the acceptance by holders of Series A Bonds of such offer shall be extended by the number of days necessary to give each such remaining holder at least 10 Business Days from its receipt of such notice to accept such offer. The Company will promptly cancel all bonds acquired by it or any affiliate pursuant to any payment, redemption or purchase of bonds pursuant to this Article III and no bonds may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such bonds. 
 SECTION 3.4 Notice of Intention to Redeem. Article XII of the Original Indenture is and shall be applicable to any redemption of Series A Bonds.

Exhibit 4.29 
 
 Description of Securities 
 Registered Pursuant to Section 12 
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
 
 As of the end of its most recent fiscal year, Spire Inc. (the Company, we, us, or our had two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended: 

Common Stock, par value 1.00 per share, and 

Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/1,000 th interest in a share of 5.90 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value 25.00 per share Series A Preferred Stock ). 

 The following summary includes a brief description of these securities, as well as certain related additional information. The summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company s Articles of Incorporation, as amended articles of incorporation ), and Bylaws, as amended bylaws ). 
 Under our articles of incorporation, we are authorized to issue up to 75,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 70,000,000 shares of common stock, 1.00 par value per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 25.00 par value per share. 
 Description of our Common Stock 
 Listing . Our outstanding shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SR. Any additional common stock we issue will also be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Liquidation Rights . In the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of our affairs voluntarily or involuntarily, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive the remainder, if any, of our assets after the payment of all our debts and liabilities and after the payment in full of any preferential amounts to which holders of any preferred stock may be entitled. 
 Voting Rights . Except as otherwise provided by law and subject to the voting rights of holders of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future, all voting power rests exclusively in the holders of shares of our common stock. Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders, including the election of directors. The common stock votes together as a single class. The holders of our common stock are not entitled to cumulate votes for the election of directors. At annual and special meetings of shareholders, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock, present in person or by proxy, constitute a quorum. 
 Dividends . Because we are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and ability to pay dividends will be dependent on the earnings and cash flows of our subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, or in the form of loans to or repayments of loans from us. Some of our subsidiaries may have restrictions on their ability to pay dividends including covenants under their borrowing arrangements and mortgage indentures, and possibly also restrictions imposed by their regulators. Currently, the Mortgage and Deed of Trust of Spire Missouri Inc., under which it issues its first mortgage bonds, contains a covenant that restricts its ability to pay dividends to us as its sole common stock shareholder. Further, the right of common shareholders to receive dividends may be subject to our prior payment of dividends on any outstanding shares of preferred stock. 
 Miscellaneous . The holders of our common stock have no preemptive or preferential rights to subscribe for or purchase any part of any new or additional issue of stock or securities convertible into stock. The outstanding shares of our common stock are, upon payment for them, fully paid and non-assessable. Our common stock does not contain any redemption provisions or conversion rights. 

Description of our Preferred Stock 
 General . Our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors (the Board to approve the issuance from time to time of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 25.00 par value per share, in one or more series, without shareholder action. The Board can determine the rights, preferences and limitations of each series and has the authority to determine or fix the following terms with respect to shares of any series of preferred stock: 

the dividend rate, the dates of payment, and the date from which dividends will accumulate, if dividends are to be cumulative; 

whether and upon what terms the shares will be redeemable; 

whether and upon what terms the shares will have a sinking fund; 

whether and upon what terms the shares will be convertible or exchangeable; 

whether the shares will have voting rights and the terms thereof; 

any amounts payable to the holders upon liquidation or dissolution, if any; 

whether interests in the preferred stock will be represented by depositary shares; and 

any other preferences, qualifications, limitations, restrictions and special or relative rights. 

 Depositary Shares . Each of our depositary shares represents a 1/1,000th interest in a share of Series A preferred stock and are evidenced by depositary receipts issued pursuant to the deposit agreement with the depositary. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each owner of a depositary receipt is entitled, in proportion to the fractional interest in the share of Series A Preferred Stock represented by the related depositary share, to all the rights, preferences and privileges of, and is subject to all of the limitations and restrictions on, the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the depositary receipt (including, without limitation, dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). 
 We may, at any time and from time to time, without notice to or the consent of holders of the depositary shares and the underlying Series A Preferred Stock, elect to issue additional depositary shares representing additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. Each such additional depositary share and the underlying share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be identical in all respects to every other depositary share and the underlying share of Series A Preferred Stock, except with respect to the date from which dividends will accumulate. 
 Series A Preferred Stock . The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs. In addition, we will generally be able to pay dividends, any redemption price and distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock only out of legally available funds for such payment (i.e., after taking account of all indebtedness and other non-equity claims). The outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were, upon payment for them, fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock do not have preemptive or subscription rights to purchase or otherwise acquire more of our stock, including their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. 
 The shares of Series A Preferred Stock are equity interests in the Company, do not constitute indebtedness, and unlike our indebtedness, will not give rise to a claim for payment of a principal amount at a particular date. As such, the Series A Preferred Stock is subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness (including without limitation indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, our senior unsecured notes and our commercial paper) and other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any of our other class or series of stock or our other securities. The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund, retirement fund or purchase fund or our other obligation to redeem, repurchase or retire the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 2 

Listing . Our outstanding depositary shares representing Series A Preferred Stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SR.PRA. We do not expect that there will be any separate trading market for the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock except as represented by the d epositary s hares. 
 Dividends . Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, when, as and if declared by the Board, are payable on the liquidation preference amount, on a cumulative basis, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year at an annual rate equal to 5.90 of the 25,000 liquidation preference per share of Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to 25.00 per depositary share). Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accumulate daily and are cumulative from May 21, 2019. During any dividend period, so long as any Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless the full cumulative dividends have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside) on the Series A Preferred Stock (and any other series of preferred stock then outstanding) through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividend shall be paid or declared on our common stock, and none of our common stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by us, directly or indirectly (other than purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of common shares pursuant to any employment contract, dividend reinvestment plan, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors, consultants or advisors) during a dividend period. 
 Each date on which dividends are payable pursuant to the foregoing clause, subject to adjustment as provided above, is a dividend payment date, and dividends for each dividend payment date are payable with respect to the dividend period (or portion thereof) ending on the day preceding such dividend payment date, in each case to holders of record as of the close of business on the 15th calendar day before such dividend payment date or such other record date not more than 60 calendar days nor less than 10 calendar days preceding such dividend payment date fixed for that purpose by the Board or any duly authorized committee of the Board in advance of payment of each particular dividend. Dividend record dates will apply regardless of whether a particular dividend record date is a business day. In the case of payments of dividends payable in arrears, the record date with respect to a dividend payment date will be such date as may be designated by the Board or any duly authorized committee of the Board. 
 The amount of the dividend per share of Series A Preferred Stock will be calculated for each dividend period (or portion thereof) on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 
 Dividend period means each period commencing on (and including) a dividend payment date and continuing to, but excluding, the next succeeding dividend payment date, except that the first dividend period for the initial issuance of Series A Preferred Stock shall commence on (and include) the original issue date. 
 Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be cumulative (i) whether or not we have earnings, (ii) whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends, (iii) whether or not such dividends are authorized or declared and (iv) whether or not any of our agreements prohibit the current payment of dividends, including any agreement relating to our indebtedness. Accordingly, if the Board or any duly authorized committee of the Board does not declare a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock payable in respect of any dividend period before the related dividend payment date, such dividend shall accumulate and an amount equal to such accumulated dividend shall become payable out of funds legally available therefor upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs or earlier redemption of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent not paid prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up or earlier redemption, as the case may be. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, will be payable on any dividend payment that may be in arrears on the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 We will not declare or pay, or set aside for payment, full dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or any Parity Stock (as defined herein) for any dividend period unless the full cumulative dividends have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside) on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock through the most recently completed dividend period for each such security. 
 3 

When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) in full on the Series A Preferred Stock or any Parity Stock on any dividend payment date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series A Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series A Preferred Stock), all dividends declared on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock and payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of such Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series A Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be declared pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accumulated but unpaid dividends per Series A Preferred Stock and all such Parity Stock payable on such dividend payment date (or, in the case of such Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the dividend payment dates pertaining to the Series A Preferred Stock, on a dividend payment date falling within the related dividend period for the Series A Preferred Stock) bear to each other. Any portion of such dividends not declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) that are payable upon the Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock in respect of such dividend period on such dividend payment date shall accumulate, and an amount equal to such undeclared portion of such dividends shall become payable out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs or earlier redemption of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock, to the extent not paid prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up or earlier redemption. 
 During any dividend period, so long as any Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless the full cumulative dividends have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside) on the Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock through the most recently completed dividend period for each such security: 

no dividend shall be paid or declared on our common stock or any other shares of Junior Stock (as defined herein) (other than a dividend payable solely in shares of Junior Stock); and 

none of our common stock or other Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by us, directly or indirectly (other than (a) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock pursuant to any employment contract, dividend reinvestment plan, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors, consultants or advisors, (b) as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock, (c) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of such Junior Stock, or (d) through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of Junior Stock) during a dividend period. 

 The Series A Preferred Stock will rank junior as to payment of dividends to any class or series of our Senior Stock (as defined herein) that we may issue in the future. If at any time we have failed to pay, on the applicable payment date, accumulated dividends on any class or series of Senior Stock, we may not pay any dividends on the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock or redeem or otherwise repurchase any shares of Series A Preferred Stock until we have paid or set aside for payment the full amount of the unpaid dividends on the Senior Stock that must, under the terms of such securities, be paid before we may pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase, the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 No dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside) at such time as the terms and provisions of any agreement of ours, including any agreement relating to our indebtedness, prohibit such declaration and payment (or declaration and setting aside a sum sufficient for the payment thereof) would constitute a breach thereof or a default thereunder, or if the declaration and payment (or the declaration and setting aside a sum sufficient for the payment thereof) shall be restricted or prohibited by law. 
 4 

Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the Board or any duly authorized committee of the Board may be declared and paid on our common stock and any other Junior Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividend. 
 The depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Series A Preferred Stock to the record holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the number of the depositary shares held by each holder on the relevant record date. The depositary will distribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of the depositary shares entitled to those distributions, unless it determines that a distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make such distribution. In that event, the depositary may, with our approval, sell such property received by it and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares entitled to such distribution in proportion to the number of the depositary shares they hold. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the Series A Preferred Stock. In the event of any distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property received by it to you based on instructions from us. The amounts distributed to holders of the depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by us on account of taxes or other governmental charges. 
 Ranking . The Series A Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to anticipated dividends (whether cumulative or non-cumulative) and distributions upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs: 

senior to our common stock and to each other class or series of our capital stock established after the original issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock that is expressly made subordinated to the Series A Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends or amounts payable on a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs (the Junior Stock 

on a parity with any class or series of our capital stock established after the original issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock that is not expressly made senior or subordinated to the Series A Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs (the Parity Stock 

junior to any class or series of our capital stock established after the original issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock that is expressly made senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends or amounts payable on a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs (the Senior Stock 

junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness (including outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities, our outstanding unsecured senior notes and our outstanding commercial paper) and other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us; and 

structurally subordinated to existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries and any future preferred stock of our subsidiaries. 

 Except as otherwise required by law, we may issue Parity Stock and Junior Stock at any time and from time to time in one or more series without the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Parity Stock with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock may include series of our preferred stock that have different dividend rates, redemption or conversion features, mechanics, dividend periods, payment of dividends (whether cumulative or non-cumulative), payment dates or record dates than the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 5 

Liquidation Rights . Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock (and any Parity Stock will be entitled to receive out of our assets legally available for distribution to shareholders, after satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations to our creditors, if any, and subject to the rights of holders of Senior Stock in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, and before any distribution of assets is made to or set aside for holders of common stock and any other Junior Stock , in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the applicable liquidation preference 25,000 per share in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to 25.00 per d epositary s hare) , plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared), if any. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from us after they have received their full liquidation preference (as defined below). 
 In any such distribution, if our assets are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and to the holders of any Parity Stock will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of those holders. In any such distribution, the liquidation preference of any holder of preferred stock means the amount payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on our assets available for such distribution), including any unpaid, accumulated, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared (and, in the case of any Parity Stock on which dividends accumulate on a non-cumulative basis, an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends, as applicable). If the liquidation preference has been paid in full to all holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and any holders of Parity Stock, the holders of our other stock shall be entitled to receive all our remaining assets according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 For purposes of this Liquidation Rights section, neither our merger or consolidation into or with any other corporation, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, nor a sale, transfer or lease of all or part of our assets, will be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs. 
 The Certificate of Designations does not contain any provision requiring funds to be set aside to protect the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock even though it is substantially in excess of the par value thereof. 
 Optional Redemption . We may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at our option: 

in whole but not in part at any time prior to August 15, 2024, within 120 days after the conclusion of any review or appeal process instituted by us following the occurrence of a Ratings Event (as defined below), at a redemption price equal to 25,500 per share of Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to 25.50 per depositary share), or 

in whole or in part on or after August 15, 2024 at a redemption price equal to 25,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to 25.00 per depositary share), plus, in each case, all accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared). 

 Ratings Event means that any nationally recognized statistical rating organization as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), or in any successor provision thereto, that then publishes a rating for us (a rating agency amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities such as the Series A Preferred Stock, which amendment, clarification or change results in: 

the shortening of the length of time the Series A Preferred Stock is assigned a particular level of equity credit by that rating agency as compared to the length of time the Series A Preferred Stock would have been assigned that level of equity credit by that rating agency or its predecessor on the initial issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock; or 

 6 

the lowering of the equity credit (including up to a lesser amount) assigned to the Series A Preferred Stock by that rating agency as compared to the equity credit assigned thereto by that rating agency or its predecessor on the initial issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock . 

 Any declared but unpaid dividends payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the dividend record date for a dividend period will not constitute a part of, or be paid to, the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather will be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on the dividend record date relating to such dividend payment date. 
 Holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 If we redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in whole or in part, the depositary will redeem a proportionate number of our depositary shares. The Series A Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or other similar provisions. Holders of the depositary shares or the shares of Series A Preferred Stock do not have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the depositary shares or the Series A Preferred Stock. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to 1/1,000th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to any dividends thereon that, pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations, are payable upon redemption. Whenever we redeem shares of the Series A Preferred Stock held by the Depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of the depositary shares representing shares of the Series A Preferred Stock so redeemed. 
 In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by the depositary either pro rata, or by lot (or, in the event the depositary shares are in the form of global depositary receipts, in accordance with the applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company DTC in compliance with then-applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE )). 
 The depositary will mail (or otherwise transmit by an authorized method) notice of redemption to holders of the depositary shares not less than 30, nor more than 60 days, prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock and the depositary shares. 
 There is no restriction on the repurchase or redemption of the depositary shares or the Series A Preferred Stock by us while there is any arrearage in the payment of dividends or sinking fund installments. 
 Redemption Procedures . If the Series A Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 days, nor more than 60 days, prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof (provided that, if the Series A Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC we may give such notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Each notice of redemption will include a statement setting forth: 

the redemption date; 

the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder; 

the redemption price; 

the place or places where holders may surrender certificates evidencing the Series A Preferred Stock for payment of the redemption price; and 

that dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accumulate from and after such redemption date. 

 7 

If notice of redemption of any Series A Preferred Stock has been given, and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by us for the benefit of the holders of any Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such Series A Preferred Stock, and such Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such Series A Preferred Stock will terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released by us, after which time the holders of such Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall look only to us for payment of the redemption price of such Series A Preferred Stock. 
 In case of any redemption of only part of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or by lot, in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC or any other similar facility in compliance with then-applicable rules of the NYSE). 
 If we redeem the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares, in whole or in part, a corresponding number of depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock held by the Depositary. The redemption price per depositary Share will be equal to 1/1,000th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to any dividends thereon that, pursuant to the provisions of the 
 Voting Rights . Shareholders of the Series A Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting stockholders. The limited voting rights of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock include the right to vote on certain matters that may affect the preference or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, if and whenever dividends on any shares of Series A Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for at least six quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors then constituting the Board shall automatically be increased by two and the holders of such Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election of the two additional members of the Board. In that event, the number of directors on the Board shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20 of the Series A Preferred Stock or of any other series of voting preferred stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the shareholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of shareholders) and at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until full cumulative dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock through the most recently completed dividend period shall have been fully paid. 
 So long as any Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or by our articles of incorporation in the future, we will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and all other series of voting preferred stock (subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph below) entitled to vote thereon (voting together as a single class), given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting: 

amend or alter the provisions of our articles of incorporation or the Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Stock so as to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any class or series of capital stock ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends and/or the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs; 

amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our articles of incorporation or the Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Stock so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; or 

 8 

consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Stock or our merger or consolidation with another entity, unless in each case (i) the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which we are not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent and (ii) such Series A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, has such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole; 

 provided, however , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other series of preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 If an amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above would materially and adversely affect the Series A Preferred Stock and one or more, but not all, series of voting preferred stock (including the Series A Preferred Stock for this purpose), then only the series materially and adversely affected by such event and entitled to vote shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of voting preferred stock). 
 To the fullest extent permitted by the law, without the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, so long as such action does not adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole, we may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series A Preferred Stock for the following purposes: 

to cure any ambiguity, omission, inconsistency or mistake in any such agreement or instrument; 

to make any provision with respect to matters or questions relating to the Series A Preferred Stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Stock and that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of the Series A Preferred Stock; or 

to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of the Series A Preferred Stock (other than any holder that consents to such change). 

 The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice, and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by us for the benefit of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to effect such redemption. 
 When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote, the depositary will mail (or otherwise transmit by an authorized method) the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares. Each record holder of depositary shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Series A Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the holder s depositary shares. Although each depositary share is entitled to 1/1,000th of a vote, the depositary can only vote whole shares of Series A Preferred Stock. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares in accordance with the instructions it receives. We have agreed to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any depositary shares, it will not vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by such depositary shares.

Anti-takeover Effects of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 It is not the intent of our Board to discourage legitimate offers to enhance shareholder value. Provisions of our articles of incorporation or bylaws, however, may have the effect of discouraging unilateral tender offers or other attempts to acquire our business. These provisions include the classification of our directors with three-year staggered terms, the requirement that director nominations by shareholders be made not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the date of the shareholder meeting, and the ability of the board, without further action of the holders of common stock, to issue one or more series of preferred stock from time to time, which may have terms more favorable than the common stock, including, among other things, preferential dividend, liquidation, voting and redemption rights. These provisions might discourage a potentially interested purchaser from attempting a unilateral takeover bid for us on terms that some shareholders might favor. If these provisions discourage potential takeover bids, they might limit the opportunity for our shareholders to sell their shares at a premium. 
 In addition, our articles of incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. Cumulative voting permits shareholders to multiply their number of votes by the total number of directors being elected and to cast their total number of votes for one or more candidates in each shareholder s discretion. 
 Our bylaws also include provisions setting forth specific conditions and restrictions under which business may be transacted at meetings of shareholders. For example, no business may be transacted at a meeting unless it is specified in the notice of meeting; otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee thereof; or brought before the meeting by a shareholder of record who provided notice and other specified information in writing to the corporate secretary not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the meeting. These provisions may restrict the content of the issues to be discussed at a shareholders meeting. 
 In addition, the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of our common or preferred stock may have an anti-takeover effect. These shares might be issued by our Board without shareholder approval in transactions that might prevent or render more difficult or costly the completion of a takeover transaction by, for example, diluting voting or other rights of the proposed acquiror. In this regard, our articles of incorporation grant the board of directors broad powers to establish the rights and preferences of the authorized but unissued preferred stock, one or more series of which could be issued entitling holders to vote separately as a class on any proposed merger or consolidation, to convert the stock into shares of our common stock or possibly other securities, to demand redemption at a specified price under prescribed circumstances related to a change in control or to exercise other rights designed to impede a takeover. 
 Missouri Shareholder Protection Statutes 
 We are subject to Missouri corporate statutes that restrict the voting rights of a person who acquires 20 or more of our outstanding common stock as well as that person s ability to enter into a business combination with us. 
 The control share acquisition statute provides that shares acquired that would cause the acquiring person s aggregate voting power to meet or exceed any of three thresholds (20 , 33-1/3 or a majority) have no voting rights unless such voting rights are granted by a majority vote of the holders of the shares not owned by the acquiring person or any of our officers or directors or employee-directors. The statute sets out a procedure under which the acquiring person may call a special shareholders meeting for the purpose of considering whether voting rights should be conferred. Acquisitions as part of a merger or exchange offer arising out of an agreement to which we are a party are exempt from the statute. 
 10 

The business combination statute restricts transactions between us and a beneficial owner of 20 or more of our voting stock. A business combination is defined in the statute as any of the following transactions with or proposed by an interested shareholder: merger, consolidation, disposition of assets, significant securities issuance, liquidation, dissolution, reclassification of securities, loan, advance, guarantee, pledge or tax credit. Generally, the statute prohibits for five years from the date one becomes an interested shareholder a business combination between us and the interested shareholder unless the business combination or the interested shareholder s stock acquisition was approved by our Board on or before that date. An interested shareholder may enter into a business combination with us after the five-year period if it is approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares not owned by the interested shareholder or if it meets certain consideration requirements. 
 Application of the control share acquisition and business combination statutes are automatic unless we take steps to opt out of their application. We have not opted out of the statutes.

Shares underlying the Units, when earned, shall be issued and delivered as provided in Section 6; provided, however, any Units deferred under the Deferred Income Plan shall be contributed in cash to the Participant s Deferred Income Plan account. 
 8. Units Non-Transferable . The Units (and any related Dividend Equivalents) shall not be transferable by Participant and may not be sold, assigned, disposed of, or pledged or hypothecated as collateral for a loan or as security for performance of any obligation or for any other purpose until after Shares underlying the Units have been issued and delivered to the Participant. 
 9. No Right to Continued Employment . Nothing in this Award shall confer on the Participant any right to continuance of employment by the Company or a subsidiary, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of Participant s employer to terminate Participant s employment at any time. 
 10. Tax Withholding and Tax Election . The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Shares underlying the Units until Participant pays to the Company in cash, or any other form of property acceptable to the Company, the amount required to be withheld for any federal, state or local income, FICA or other taxes of any kind with respect to such shares. The Participant may, by notice to the Company, elect to have such withholding satisfied by a reduction of the number of whole Shares otherwise so deliverable, such reduction to be calculated based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares. Fair Market Value shall be determined as the closing price of common shares of the Company on the Vesting Date. The Company and its subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct such taxes, from any payment of any kind otherwise due to Participant. Dividend Equivalents that become payable as provided in this Award shall be subject to tax withholdings in accordance with tax laws then in effect. 

The foregoing notwithstanding, any Units deferred under the Deferred Income Plan shall be subject to withholding of such amounts as the Company reasonably may determine are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable Federal, state, local, or foreign law or regulation. 
 11. Confidential Information and Restrictions on Soliciting Employees. Notwithstanding any provision of this Award to the contrary, the Participant shall pay to the Company the Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying the Units that vest and are issued to Participant or deferred to the Participant s Deferred Income Plan account under this Award if, during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending 18 months following the date the Participant s employment with the Company and its subsidiaries terminates (provided that such termination is other than a Change in Control Termination), the Participant: (1) discloses Confidential Information, as defined below, to any person not employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or not engaged to render services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) Solicits Employees, as defined below. Fair Market Value shall be calculated on the date of the first violation of this Section 11. 
 For purposes of this Section 11, Confidential Information means information concerning the Company, its subsidiaries and their business that is not generally known outside the Company, and includes (A) trade secrets; (B) intellectual property; (C) methods of operation and processes; (D) information regarding present and/or future products, developments, processes and systems; (E) information on customers or potential customers, including customers names, sales records, prices, and other terms of sales and cost information; (F) personnel data; (G) business plans, marketing plans, financial data and projections; and (H) information received in confidence from third parties. This provision shall not preclude the Participant from use or disclosure of information known generally to the public other than by his or her disclosure of such information or of information not considered confidential by persons engaged in the business conducted by the Company or subsidiary or from disclosure required by law or court order. 
 Solicits Employees means the Participant s direct or indirect hire, solicit to hire, or attempt to induce any employee of the Company or a subsidiary (who is an employee of the Company or a subsidiary as of the time of such hire or solicitation or attempt to hire) to leave the employment of the Company or a subsidiary, or the Participant s direct or indirect hire, solicit to hire, or attempt to induce any former employee of the Company or a subsidiary (who was employed by the Company or a subsidiary within the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of such hire or solicitation or attempt to hire) to leave the employment of the former employee s then-current employer. 
 12. Integration. This Award and the other documents referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto which form a part hereof, contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter. There are no restrictions, agreements, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings with respect to the subject matter hereof other than those expressly set forth herein. This Award, including without limitation the Plan, supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to its subject matter and may only be amended by mutual written consent of the parties. 
 13. Governing Law . This Award shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri, without regard to the provisions governing conflict of laws. 

14. Compliance with Laws and Regulations . The obligations of the Company under this Award shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required. 
 15. Participant Acknowledgment . By accepting this Award, the Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan, and acknowledges that all decisions, determinations and interpretations of the Committee in respect of the Plan and this Award shall be final and conclusive. Participant acknowledges that this award is subject to the company's recoupment policy. 
 
 In addition, the Participant expressly acknowledges that violation by the Participant of Section 11 of this Award will obligate the Participant to pay to the Company the Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying the Units that become vested or are issued pursuant to Section 6. 

Appendix to Performance Contingent Stock Unit Award 
 Performance Period . The Performance Period begins October 1, 2019 and ends September 30, 2022. 
 Dividend Related Earnings . Dividend Related Earnings means average Earnings Per Share over the Performance Period in excess of the annualized declared dividend per share for the Common Stock as of the Award Date. 
 Earnings Per Share . For purposes of this Award, Earnings Per Share means net economic earnings per share as reported in the Company s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchanges Commission reporting the results for quarterly and annual periods in the Performance Period. The number of shares of Common Stock used in calculating Earnings Per Share will be consistent with that number used to calculate the Company s basic earnings per share in its periodic reports. 
 Performance Metrics . The Performance Metrics Formula for this Award that the Committee will use to adjust the number of Units that will Vest upon the Company s achievement of Dividend Related Earnings include two performance metrics: Average Earnings Per Share (50 weighting), and Relative Total Shareholder Return (50 weighting) as described in more detail below: 
 Metric 1 Average Earnings Per Share Example Achieve Company Average Earnings Per Share over the Performance Period as specified below. Assumes a target grant of 200 total units.

High Performance for this metric reflects a 200 multiplier factor of target. 
 Metric 2 Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Example Achieve level of TSR relative to established comparator group using average stock price for the last twenty (20) trading days of the last quarter of fiscal year 2018 and average stock price for the last twenty (20) trading days of the last quarter of fiscal year 2021, plus the value of reinvested dividends as provided below. Assumes a target grant of 200 total units.

The Calculated Percentile and the number of Vested Units in the above table shall be changed by the Committee in the event that the TSR performance of any company in the comparator group cannot be determined due to a corporate event such as a bankruptcy, merger or acquisition. 
 Vesting of this Relative TSR metric is further limited to the achievement of positive absolute Total Shareholder Return for the performance period. If absolute Total Shareholder Return is negative, then the maximum number of units earned under this Metric 2 shall not exceed the target number of Units and related Dividend Equivalents. 
 High Performance for this metric reflects a 200 multiplier factor of target. 
 Performance Metrics Formula - Example . 

o 
 
 If performance on each of the Performance Metrics is below threshold, then no Units shall vest, and all Units and related Dividend Equivalents shall be forfeited. 

o 
 
 If performance on one or more of the Performance Metrics is achieved at or above Threshold, the number of Units that vest (and the amount of Dividend Equivalents that shall be payable) will equal the aggregate number of Units earned under each Performance Metric. 

o 
 
 If performance on one or more of the Performance Metrics has been achieved above the Threshold levels of performance, the Administrator shall interpolate for performance between the applicable levels for each Performance Metric and shall determine the number of Units that shall vest (and the amount of Dividend Equivalents that shall be payable). 

o 
 
 Maximum number of units that shall vest is capped at 200 of target, and achievable if both Performance Metrics achieve High Performance levels. 

 Because the Company cannot issue fractional shares, the administrator will round down to the nearest whole number of Units in all calculations.
